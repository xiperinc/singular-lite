# Changelog

All notable changes to **singular** are recorded here. This project follows
semantic versioning. The `schemaVersion` (the `.vN` contract of the JSON schemas +
config shape) is called out separately from the package version, because consumers
and the plugin negotiate on `schemaVersion`.

---

## [0.23.3] — 2026-10-02 — Lifecycle liveness and an honest ledger

Repairs for the stalls the 2026-09-14 field campaign hit, each of which ended
with an operator finishing state by hand. `schemaVersion` stays **v2**.
Acceptance criteria are unchanged, and the landing rate was deliberately not
optimised in this release; that waits for the clock work, which needs the
telemetry below.

- **Durable lease state survives compatibility writes (`15c68a4`).**
  `singular_lease_write` rebuilt the record from a fixed allowlist and dropped
  `operatorReentries`, `campaignBinding`, `nextAction` and `failureReason` on
  every write, which also disabled the 0.22.0 history guard that depends on
  `operatorReentries`. Unknown keys are now carried forward.
- **Reserve-before-bind deadlock (`edb39bb`).** A STOP-frozen or crashed
  driver's `launched` dispatch record is closed independently of the
  successor's lease instead of being counted as a running worker forever.
- **Per-generation dispatch exits (`81c0cc9`).** The exit file was per task, so
  a predecessor's exit sat on the successor's path and the reaper pinned the
  record as running. Exits are generation-qualified (the legacy path is still
  read).
- **Driver admitted to its own reservation's retained worktree (`aaa0129`).**
  The retained-worktree guard refused the `planned` lease the scheduler had just
  handed the driver; it now compares reservation owner and generation.
- **Interrupted continuation claims are repairable (`40479da`).** A crash
  between the lease and dispatch-record commits left a consumed one-shot
  authority with no attempt; a re-claim by the same execution run repairs it
  without granting an extra invocation.
- **Ownership proved before acceptance is published (`0f28ec2`).** A
  stale-generation driver could stamp `accepted` on a successor's lease and
  queue its packet before the owner check ran; the owner check now precedes
  publication.
- **Reservation refusals counted; honest call ledger (`11edc40`).** Refusals of
  the same normalized condition accumulate and feed the breaker (park at 3);
  the call ledger records operation ids, host wall time, provider durations and
  missing-vs-zero usage.
- **Process-group fence (`376f4b3`).** Bind-failure cleanup killed only the
  detached child, so provider grandchildren survived and kept writing. Cleanup
  now kills the tree and classifies the outcome, with an engine-executable exit
  for the fence state.

**Verification.** Full suite on the release tree (`7515dd0`), batched, on this
host: 236 pass / 17 fail of 253. Fourteen failures fail identically on 0.23.2
(`7ef2c52`): accept-existing-packet, candidate-recovery, capability-runtime,
continuity-core, ctx-artifact-scan-hook, ctx-paired-audit,
ctx-rehydrate-authored-config, detached-dispatch, dispatch-auto-accept,
orphan-continuation, per-try-artifacts, session-affinity, singular-brand and
storage-proof-redlog. Two are host-environmental: test-setup failed only under
low disk and passes in isolation; test-exit-attribution's fixture run id `RUN-2`
matches any live `RUN-2026…` run through the reaper's `pgrep -f` probe, and the
test passes with host-unique ids. test-frozen-campaign-terminal, run alone, passes
all 15 assertions and prints its `PASS:` line, then exits 1 from its known
teardown (baseline entry 5). All seventeen are fixed in 0.23.4.
`tests/BASELINE-FAILURES.md` listed only six of the pre-existing failures.

## [0.23.2] — 2026-09-16 — Correction to the 0.23.1 drift fix

- The 0.23.1 exclusion of `SINGULAR_INTEGRATION_RECEIPT_FILE` from the
  frozen campaign identity was applied to the wrong projection path and had
  no effect; it now applies in `resolved_settings_projection`, which feeds
  campaign drift verification. No other change.

## [0.23.1] — 2026-09-16 — Host-managed invocation admission

- **Host-managed invocation admission and observability (TASK-1115).** The
  invocation envelope (authorization, model, provider, policy, capability)
  is bound at the host boundary, budgeted and observable; a retained
  session whose envelope binding has changed is refused for resume
  (exit 86) instead of being fed history it may no longer be authorized
  for, and the binding is persisted into the session-meta at creation so
  that check is live on real sessions (round-2 audit finding F1, closed).
  Gate: the declared nine-script gate, host-executed; fresh claude-opus-5
  audit accepted in round 2 of 2. Round-1 P2/P3 findings stay on the
  backlog.
- **Fix: integration refused as "campaign drift" under 0.23.0.** The
  reconciler sets `SINGULAR_INTEGRATION_RECEIPT_FILE` per integration run;
  the campaign manifest captured every `SINGULAR_*` setting, so any manifest
  frozen before that variable existed reported drift at integration entry.
  Per-run settings are now excluded from the frozen identity. TASK-1115
  itself was merged by hand for this reason (recorded in the merge commit).

## [0.23.0] — 2026-09-16 — Fair incremental reconciliation

Closes the brain rescue campaign. `schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

- **Fair incremental reconciliation discovery (TASK-1114).** The reconciler
  keeps a durable reconcile index (`engine/reconcile_index.py`) so steady
  cycles examine only what changed since the last acknowledged sweep instead
  of re-observing every retained artifact; `integrate.sh` and `ops.sh` read
  and settle the same index, `singular ops health` reports it, and
  `docs/incremental-reconciliation.md` records the contract. Worker
  candidate produced by a contained claude-opus-5/high implementer, adopted
  under supervisor provenance after two packet-format slips, then qualified
  on exact source: gate green, fresh claude-opus-5 audit accepted (1 P2,
  3 P3 backlog). Proof: `tests/test-incremental-reconcile.sh`,
  `tests/test-ops-health.sh`.
- **Packet hygiene.** A complete state packet that lacks only `createdAt`
  is stamped by the host instead of refused (`packet repaired: defaulted
  missing createdAt`); the omission had parked an audited-clean candidate.
- **Campaign evaluation.** `claudedocs/brain-campaign-evaluation-20260916.md`
  and its raw metrics: spend, cycle times, where the time went, and the
  engine recommendations that follow from six days of field operation.
- **Known limits.** TASK-1115 (host-managed invocation admission and
  observability) is parked: its final bounded attempt passed the host gate but the fresh
  audit found one P1 (the envelope binding is never persisted into the
  session-meta, so the new resume-refusal check is inert); the candidate is
  preserved on its branch for a future round. The two lifecycle deadlocks documented
  in the 2026-09-14 audit remain open. Final host regression on this tree:
  228 pass / 15 pre-existing host failures (245 scripts).

## [0.22.1] — 2026-09-15 — B5: evaluation harness and campaign analysis

Completes the brain campaign. TASK-1106 was accepted by the fresh
claude-opus-5 audit at 13:13Z and integrated (`8ed75c3`) minutes after 0.22.0
was cut — the auto-integration had been refused for 100 minutes because the
release edits sat uncommitted in the live target checkout ("working tree has
non-control-state changes"), which is now a documented operating rule.

- **B5 — Evaluation and operational documentation.** A deterministic labeled
  retrieval corpus and harness (`singular context evaluate`) over contracts,
  prior failures, wrong versions, stale docs, missing knowledge, long
  documents and role restrictions, reporting inclusion/recall within budget,
  incorrect selections, omissions and abstention with missing-data semantics
  preserved; a campaign analysis command over events and runner-result
  sidecars (invocations and tokens by role and model, retries, time to
  integration, failure causes, missing observations); adoption/rollback
  instructions and a findings report from the retained campaign
  observations (`docs/brain-build-plan/context-findings.md`,
  `context-adoption.md`). Proof: `tests/test-context-evaluation-e2e.sh`,
  plus the five-script task gate and the exact-tree integration gate.
- No engine change relative to 0.22.0.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-09-15 — A brain, and the red tape cut

0.21 made the factory fast. This release gives it a memory and a knowledge
service, and then removes the ceremony that a three-day field campaign showed
was stalling the factory more than protecting it. Everything below landed
through the engine's own reviewed integration path on the `codex/brain-integration`
line (campaign BRAIN-RESCUE-20260910, runtimes A9–A15); the last lifecycle
fixes were applied directly under operator authority and are marked as such.
`schemaVersion` stays **v2**; new schemas are additive.

### The brain: vendored knowledge, bounded context, reviewed memory

- **B1 — Package and ingest (`singular manifest gen|check|lint|bless`).** The
  upstream `singular-brain` generator is vendored byte-for-byte under
  `vendor/singular-brain` and consumed through a validated adapter for
  `singular-brain.manifest.v1`. Paths resolve against declared roots with
  symlink containment; stale, superseded, malformed, duplicate, quarantined,
  wrong-root and missing-source entries are classified, not guessed; live
  source hashes are kept distinct from review hashes. Node stays optional
  when brain is unconfigured. Proof: `tests/test-brain-ingestion-e2e.sh`.
- **B2 — Context service (`singular context build|search|get|explain`).** A
  local Python library (`engine/context_service.py`, `engine/brain_documents.py`)
  builds one immutable, atomically published bundle from brain documents,
  selected worktree code and run records: full-source and excerpt hashes,
  locations, selection reasons, budget usage and omissions. Mandatory task
  constraints and open obligations outrank optional material and an
  aggregate budget fails explicitly when they cannot fit. Search/get/explain
  are read-only by construction and are proven so under an OS deny-write
  policy. Proof: `tests/test-context-service-e2e.sh`.
- **B3 — Invocation coverage.** Planner and worker first attempts and retries
  receive the service's bundle regardless of the session router's choice;
  resumes receive a documented delta; auditors stay fresh and receive only
  policy-selected references, never a worker-authored conclusion
  (`engine/evidence_delivery.py` brokers what each role may see). Feature-off
  behaviour is unchanged. Proof: `tests/test-context-invocation-e2e.sh`.
- **B4 — Reviewed memory (`singular memory propose|review|approve|reject|
  quarantine|supersede|tombstone|checkpoint|show|rebuild`).** Model-written
  content starts *proposed* and is never trusted automatically; approval
  authority is verified, not a caller label. One transaction and snapshot
  contract: writers drain prepared journals before reading lifecycle state,
  journals bind expected and resulting record revisions, recovery applies a
  successor only to its recorded predecessor and fails closed on ambiguity,
  retirement is monotonic, derived index refresh follows the authoritative
  commit, and an index rebuild can never resurrect a tombstone. Memory
  sources participate in delta revocation and both context-bundle schema
  copies; the memory credential key never reaches provider children.
  Proof: `tests/test-memory-lifecycle-e2e.sh`, `tests/test_memory_lifecycle.py`
  (14 cases). Independently audited on exact source by claude-opus-5 with
  no blocking finding (AF-1117-1..3 are P2/P3 backlog).
- **B5 — Evaluation harness.** Not in this release; TASK-1106 is queued
  behind it (see "Known limits").

### Providers: per-role runners, OS-enforced containment, a review policy

- **Per-role runners** (`roleRunners` in `singular.config.json`): implementer,
  auditor, planner, decider, critic, supervisor and integrator each select
  their adapter. The field campaign ran claude-opus-5/high implementers,
  claude-opus-5/medium auditors and gpt-6-astra/low intelligence roles.
- **claude-run.sh** now contains *writable* levels too: an l1/l2 worker runs
  under `sandbox-exec` with the repository root and the durable state
  directory denied and only its worktree, TMPDIR and build cache allowed;
  `SINGULAR_RUNNER_REQUIRE_OS_WORKSPACE=1` fails closed (exit 78) when the
  OS sandbox is unavailable. Read-only levels stay read-only by policy, and
  the auditor's model/effort are configured explicitly
  (`SINGULAR_CLAUDE_MODEL/EFFORT`, level-keyed `SINGULAR_CLAUDE_L2_*`) rather
  than inferred from prompt filenames, which the evidence broker rewrites.
- **Programmable review policy** (`engine/review_policy.py`,
  `singular review-policy effective|show|check|record|grant|backfill|backlog`):
  bounded rounds per logical change (default 2), blocking severities
  (P0/P1), P2/P3 to a durable backlog, task-bound exceptions with hashed
  evidence, and a ledger that is never reset — historical rounds are
  backfilled, not forgotten.

### Lifecycle: the recoveries a real campaign needed

- **Owner-generation reservations** (`engine/task_lifecycle.py`,
  `engine/lifecycle.sh`): reserve, bind-dispatch, record-attempt, finish,
  finalize and reconcile are compare-and-set on `reservationOwner@generation`
  and campaign binding, so a stale reaper, a crashed driver or a second
  scheduler can never overwrite live work. Accepted candidates are retained
  with hashed packet/audit/verification identity; `singular recover candidate
  --action repair|regate` authorizes a bounded successor.
- **Continuation authority**: `singular recover orphan-reservation` and
  `singular recover continuation` turn an unlaunched reservation or a started
  attempt that ended *outcome-unknown* (driver interrupted) into exactly one
  additional worker invocation, with the partial bytes snapshot-bound and the
  reservation base checked by ancestry (0.22.0 closes the outcome-unknown
  case; before it, an interrupted attempt could not be continued at all).
- **Campaign freeze**: `singular campaign start --id … --replace` binds an
  immutable runtime, config and gate epoch; every driver, auditor and
  integrator verifies that binding at entry and refuses on drift. Gates are
  re-published per epoch (`promote-gate`), and the doctor reports role
  routing, sandbox posture and frontier health.

### Cut the red tape (A15, operator-applied, 2026-09-14)

A 48-hour audit (`claudedocs/engine-architecture-audit-20260914.md`) found
that every stall of the campaign was the lifecycle layer refusing its own
legitimate state — one stray `"]` in a *successful* worker's packet deadlocked
the queue — while the product guards never false-positived. So:

- **Packet extraction repairs shape, not content.** `singular_extract_json`
  drops unmatched closers, closes unclosed brackets and trailing commas as a
  last resort, never touches string content, and logs `packet repaired: …`.
  The real field packet is a fixture (`tests/test-worker-packet-repair.sh`).
- **`singular unpark` yields a dispatchable lease.** The prior attempt is
  archived into `attemptHistory`/`terminalDispositionHistory` with an
  `operatorReentries[]` record, so `reserve()` admits the re-entry; a refused
  planned reservation whose lease carries history is released, never deleted
  (`tests/test-operator-reentry.sh`).
- **The engine refreshes retained branches itself.** A retained worker branch
  that fell behind the admitted base (the reconciler's own control-state
  commits do this every cycle) is merged forward by
  `singular_refresh_retained_branch` — event `l1.base_refreshed`; conflicts
  still refuse (`tests/test-retained-base-refresh.sh`).
- **A format slip is not a product failure.** The first
  `worker-no-packet`/`packet-invalid` on an unchanged candidate gets one
  re-emit (`l1.packet_format_retry_eligible`); a repeat parks as before.

### Known limits

- Two lifecycle deadlocks are documented but not yet fixed in the engine
  (audit §5): a STOP-frozen driver does not finalize its dispatch record, and
  the retained-worktree guard refuses the driver's own `planned` reservation.
  Both have operator workarounds recorded in the campaign state.
- The full regression on this tree reports the same pre-existing host
  failures as 0.21.0's line (`test-accept-existing-packet`,
  `test-orphan-continuation`, `test-per-try-artifacts`); the exact counts of
  this cut's run are in the release commit message.
- B5 (evaluation harness and operational documentation) is not included.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-09-05 — Throughput without assumption

The 0.20 line finished the governance work: every decision in a run is bound,
budgeted, and terminates. This release turns to the other half of a factory,
throughput, and it starts from a measurement rather than a hunch. The
35-hour field campaign on the previous engine spent 855 provider invocations
to integrate six tasks. Planners and critics took 430 of them; the critic
returned `revise` on 113 of 140 critiques, 335 of its findings were marked
blocking, and every node parked on revision-budget exhaustion. Per accepted
task the host ran the consumer's full regression suite four times on trees it
had already proven. None of that produced software. `schemaVersion` stays
**v2**.

### The plan critic is calibrated, and its findings travel

- **Severities now have binding meanings.** The prompt reserves `blocking` for
  defects only the planner can fix (owned-file collisions, undeclared
  dependencies on unintegrated work, unverifiable acceptance criteria,
  duplicates, batch tasks that cannot land independently, contract
  violations); design completeness a task file cannot carry is `should-fix`
  or `note`.
- **The host enforces them.** A `revise` verdict that names no blocking
  finding is downgraded to `approve` (`plan.critique_downgraded`), findings
  intact, rationale annotated. `SINGULAR_PLAN_CRITIQUE_REQUIRE_BLOCKING=0`
  restores verdict-as-written.
- **Approved batches carry their findings.** Should-fix and note findings are
  appended to every candidate as `## Plan critique (advisory)` before the
  approved snapshot is taken (so replays restore them). `singular_task_json`
  exposes them as `planCritique`; the implementer prompt renders them as work
  to address-or-decline and the auditor prompt as something to check. They
  never widen scope. `SINGULAR_PLAN_CRITIQUE_ADVISORY=0` disables it.
- **A repository without `prompts/plan-critic.md` no longer runs the critic
  blind.** `singular init` copies prompt templates once (`cp -n`), so repos
  initialized before the critic existed had no policy and parked every plan
  on an empty verdict. The engine template is the fallback, recorded as
  `ctx.plan_critic_prompt_fallback`.

### Gate ceremony is proof-scoped

- **`SINGULAR_AUDIT_VERIFY=auto` is the default.** The disposable rerun of the
  worker gate before the auditor happens only when the worker gate cannot
  stand on its own: a high-risk task, an outcome other than a clean `passed`
  at the exact committed head, a source-integrity anomaly, or a report from
  another phase. Otherwise the host-executed worker gate (gate-check.sh ran
  it, not the model) is hash-bound as the audit's gate evidence
  (`audit.verification_skipped`), and the exact-tree integration gate remains
  the clean-checkout proof. `1` restores the unconditional rerun, `0` never
  reruns.
- **The auditor no longer pays to echo the host.** The verification
  classification is a host fact; when the model's `verificationResults`
  aggregate disagreed, 0.20 rejected the verdict and spent another auditor
  pass at the highest effort setting. The host now rewrites the aggregate to
  its own classification, keeps the model's product verdict, and preserves
  the original beside the record (`l1.audit_verification_normalized`).
  `SINGULAR_AUDIT_VERIFY_NORMALIZE=0` restores the retry.
- **Promotion cites the integration proof.** integrate.sh already proves each
  merge on a disposable checkout of the exact staged tree. gate-check.sh now
  records passing integration-phase gates in a proof ledger keyed by tree
  (`.singular-state/proofs/<tree>.json`: command, campaign binding, report and
  log hashes). When the tree about to be promoted is byte-identical, the
  promoter reuses that proof instead of re-executing the suite in the weaker
  origin checkout (`gate_promotion.proof_reused`); any binding mismatch,
  changed tree, or age past `SINGULAR_PROMOTE_PROOF_TTL_SEC` (7 days) runs the
  gate. `SINGULAR_PROMOTE_PROOF_REUSE=0` forces a fresh run. Only the host
  writes the ledger, only for integration-phase passes with verified integrity.

### Ceremony is measured

- **`singular metrics` reports per-role invocations and tokens**
  (`aggregate.roles`) and a `ceremony` block: control-plane versus implementer
  invocation and input-token fractions, invocations per accepted task, and
  input tokens per integration, all from the runner-result sidecars every
  invocation already writes. The field audit had to reconstruct these by hand.

### The engine's own gate is four times faster

- **`tests/run.sh` runs test files in parallel** with `SINGULAR_TEST_JOBS=N`.
  Results print in discovery order, so PASS/FAIL lines, the summary and
  `progress.jsonl` look exactly like a serial run; unset or `1` is the
  historical loop byte-for-byte. A file that must not share the machine
  declares `# singular-test: serial` and runs after the batch. On the
  reference machine the 211-file suite went from 57 to 12 minutes with six
  jobs; this repository's `gateCommand` now uses four.

### The oldest bash on the machine is a test subject

- `tests/test-bash32-parse.sh` parses `lib.sh` and every file it sources under
  `/bin/bash` 3.2 when one exists. Tests that restrict `PATH` run engine
  scripts under that interpreter, whose parser scans a heredoc inside a command
  substitution for quotes and backticks; a single apostrophe in a comment there
  had turned into eight unrelated adapter failures during this release.

### Doctor reports interpreter crashes

- `runtime.interpreter-crashes` scans `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` (macOS)
  for bash, Python and git crash reports from the last 24 hours and warns with
  the counts and the newest timestamp. During this release's validation the
  Homebrew bash 5.3.9 segfaulted twenty times inside Apple's `os_log`
  preferences refresh under six-way test load; every one of those became a
  random red gate or an empty test log, and nothing in the engine could tell
  that apart from a product failure. Now the operator is told first.

### The planner template is stack-neutral

- The shipped `l1-planner.md` hard-coded one consumer's toolchain (a Go gate
  command, `internal/<area>/` paths, `_test.go` suffixes), so a fresh
  `singular init` planned Go tasks for every repository. `[GATE-COMMAND]` and
  `[AREA-PATHS]` are rendered from `singular.config.json`.

### Upgrade note

- Repositories that copied `prompts/plan-critic.md` before this release keep
  their copy; refresh it from `templates/prompts/plan-critic.md` to get the
  severity contract, or delete it to follow the engine template.
- A task that previously parked as `audit-infra` because the disposable rerun
  could not be provisioned will now be audited on its worker gate evidence.
  Set `SINGULAR_AUDIT_VERIFY=1` to keep the old behavior.

---

## [0.20.0] — 2026-08-18 — Governed by default

The context subsystem was built, tested, and shipped switched off. This release
turns it on, and makes the one guarantee that should never have had a switch
structural. `schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

**Read the upgrade note below before running an existing repo.** Two behaviors
change in opposite directions: runs that previously never resumed will begin
resuming, and runs that previously resumed freely will begin being refused.

### The independence pin is no longer behind a flag

The guarantee that an auditor never grades work it already has an opinion about
lived *below* the `SINGULAR_CTX_ROUTING` early return, and that flag defaulted to
`0`. So it did not hold in a default install.

This was not theoretical. `SINGULAR_SESSION_AFFINITY` defaults to `1`, the run id
is fixed once per driver invocation, and the reviewer session-meta is finalized
after every audit specifically "so a later audit try (this run) can resume it".
The wrapped decider takes no `<step>` argument and no gate in its ladder names
`final-audit`, so it could not tell an audit from an implementation step. On a
retry, the reviewer resumed the very session that had rejected the previous
attempt and graded the fix from inside its own prior verdict.

- **The pin is now evaluated above the routing flag.** It binds with
  `SINGULAR_CTX_ROUTING` unset, `0`, or `1`. There is no knob, and no combination
  of knobs, that reaches it. This is the one deliberate departure from OFF-parity:
  with routing off the router is still byte-identical to the legacy decider for
  every step *except* an independence-required one.
- **The independence set grew from two steps to four.** `final-audit` and
  `paired-audit` are joined by `re-critique` and `critic-recheck`. Both skeptic
  resume authorities were already written and both are inert; pinning them now
  means whichever consult hook lands first is born correct, rather than inheriting
  independence by accident of a hard-coded set.
- `paired-audit` was already structurally fresh — its call site passes no
  `--session-meta` and no `--resume-session` — so that arm is defense-in-depth.
  The live guarantee rested entirely on `final-audit`, which is exactly the arm
  that was disabled.

### The context subsystem ships ON

`SINGULAR_CTX_ROUTING`, `SINGULAR_PLANNER_SESSION`, `SINGULAR_CTX_PACKET`, and
`SINGULAR_PLAN_CRITIQUE` now default to `1`. The defaults live in one place in
`engine/lib.sh`; every escape hatch is intact, and setting any of them to `0`
restores the 0.19.0 behavior for that feature.

`SINGULAR_REHYDRATE` and `SINGULAR_CTX_GRAPH` stay opt-in on purpose: rehydration
selects nodes contradictions-first but then truncates *within* a section
content-blind, so the line that mattered can be cut from a section chosen
precisely because it mattered. That is fixed before rehydrate is promoted.

### The planner is no longer the least-governed role

The planner is the longest-lived session in the engine by design — its gates key
on node lineage rather than run id specifically so one session can decompose a
multi-slice node across runs — and it was the one role with no context-size gate.
The shortest-lived sessions carried the most gates and the longest-lived carried
the fewest.

- **Gate 12, window-pressure**, added to the planner ladder. Earlier gates keep
  their reason ordering.
- **A canonical per-node planner transcript** (`sessions/planner/<node>.log`) now
  accumulates across runs beside the session meta, truncated whenever the decision
  is fresh. The per-run planner log could not serve: a planner session outlives
  the run, so at decide time the current run's log does not exist yet and
  measuring it would fail closed on every fresh run.
- **No diff-volume gate for the planner, deliberately.** For a task role, churn
  means the ground moved under work in progress. For a planner, churn is the job.
  The correct churn guard is the ancestry check it already has, which proves the
  tree was extended rather than rewritten. Recorded as a decision, not left as an
  omission.

### Context windows come from the provider

The window-pressure gate assumed a 200 000-token window for every provider while
the engine can drive seven, and it never asked which one was running.

- **`contextWindowTokens` per provider in `engine/providers.json`**, resolved
  through the runner via `singular_runner_provider_identity`. No new env knob: a
  deployment that changes provider changes its budget. `SINGULAR_SESSION_WINDOW_TOKENS`
  remains as an explicit override.
- Values ship seeded uniformly at the 200 000 the gate already assumed, so no
  deployment's arithmetic changes. They are a conservative engine budget, not a
  vendor specification — guessing high is the unsafe direction, and three shipped
  providers proxy an arbitrary operator-selected model, so for those the window is
  not a property of the provider at all. Raising one is a deliberate act.
- **The estimate now accounts for unmeasured overhead.** `bytes/4` measured the
  transcript file and silently assumed the system prompt, tool schemas, and
  injected packet were free. A fixed allowance is added before comparison —
  hard-wired rather than exposed, because a knob defaulted to `0` would
  reintroduce the error it exists to correct.

### `singular doctor` reports the governance posture

- Which gates are live, as one line, plus the structural guarantees that have no
  knob.
- A dependent feature enabled without its dependency (`SINGULAR_CTX_SUBGRAPH_REHYDRATE`
  without the graph, for example) now warns instead of silently doing nothing.

### Upgrade note

The risk in this release is behavioral, not structural.

- **Audits that used to resume now start fresh.** Any repo running defaults was
  resuming the reviewer session at `final-audit` on retry attempts. Those now
  return `fresh tainted`. Expect more auditor invocations and, on tasks that
  retry, audit verdicts that no longer carry the previous attempt's reasoning —
  which is the point. There is no opt-out.
- **Runs that never resumed will begin resuming.** `SINGULAR_PLANNER_SESSION=1`
  means planner sessions now persist and resume across runs where their gates
  allow.
- **Plan batches can now be parked.** `SINGULAR_PLAN_CRITIQUE=1` turns the critic
  from observe-only into an enforcement layer: a `revise` or `park` verdict is now
  acted on before L0 import, at the cost of one critic run per batch.
  `SINGULAR_PLAN_REVISE_MAX` defaults to `1`, so a `revise` verdict gets one
  revision round and then parks — no batch is stranded.
- **An A/B control arm must now be explicit.** The M0 control baseline is defined
  by knob-state, and the engine's baseline moved: a default drive run now has
  `SINGULAR_CTX_PACKET` and `SINGULAR_CTX_ROUTING` active. Anyone running the
  experiment harness must set both to `0` to get a control arm. The recorded
  `arm-knob-state.json` is unaffected — it always captures the run's real values.
- **Rollback** is per-feature: set the specific knob to `0`. The independence pin
  has no rollback by design.
- Note that `singular.config.json`'s `env{}` block is applied *over* the process
  environment, so in a repo that pins a knob there, `VAR=0 singular …` does not
  override it — edit the config instead.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-08-16 — The right hand for each role

Launch release. Grok Build becomes a first-class, proven provider, and the
engine gains role-split provider routing: one provider implements, another
plans, audits and decides. No orchestration semantics or schema shape change;
`schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

### Grok Build is a real provider now

The adapter existed but had never been run against the installed CLI; auditing
it against Grok 1.0.4 found it was dispatching a model that does not exist.

- **Model correctness.** The default model id was `grok-build` — the product
  name, never a model id. Every invocation ever constructed had asked for a
  nonexistent model. The default is now `grok-4.6` (the CLI's own default),
  overridable via `SINGULAR_GROK_DEFAULT_MODEL` and the existing per-role
  `SINGULAR_GROK_*_MODEL` envs.
- **Binary stability.** Every live invocation now pins `--no-auto-update`, so
  the provider's bootstrap can never swap the executable underneath a
  containment-critical run.
- **Session affinity.** The runner contract advertises `--session-meta` and
  `--resume-session` for every runner; grok-run rejected both with exit 2, so
  every host call site that passed them died before reaching the provider.
  Both are accepted now: `--session-meta` records the provider's real
  `sessionId` from the envelope, and `--resume-session` refuses with the
  proven resume-refusal code 86 (fresh-run fallback) rather than guessing at
  an unproven resume path.
- **Structured failure truth.** Deterministic envelope tests prove the grok
  path through the shared classifier: HTTP 429 → `usage-limit`/`quota`,
  503/529 → `provider-overloaded` (asserted *distinct* from quota — conflating
  them buys a 30-minute quota nap for a blip that clears in seconds), missing
  quota totals render as `unknown`, never a guessed number.
- **Doctor honesty.** `provider.authentication` for grok was unconditionally
  true — an unauthenticated host passed preflight and failed later, mid-run.
  It now probes reality (auth env vars or credential-file existence; the file
  is never opened), with a remediation hint. The doctor model default is
  `grok-4.6`.
- **Test surface.** The grok contract suite grows from 11 to 16 cases:
  installed-CLI argv determinism, structured 429/503+529 classification,
  malformed-envelope failure, session-meta/resume-refusal, all on a mock that
  emits the real 1.0.4 envelope shape. Two harness defects fixed in the
  process: the mock drained an inherited stdin (wedging the suite when run
  from a live pipe), and its success envelope was generated inside an
  *unquoted* heredoc — a backticked command in a comment there executed
  through PATH back into the mock itself and fork-bombed the host. The
  delimiter is quoted now; the comment says why it must stay that way.

### Role-split provider routing (singular-ext/grok-implementer)

A new opt-in module routes the L2 implementer to the Grok adapter while every
other role — planner, critic, auditor, decider, integrator, supervisor,
assistant — stays on `SINGULAR_RUNNER`. Under this module `SINGULAR_RUNNER`
names the *non-implementer* provider; the module deliberately does not let it
capture L2 (that would silently undo the split). `SINGULAR_GROK_IMPLEMENTER=0`
is the explicit off switch, and a missing adapter fails at module load, not
after N tasks have quietly run on a provider the operator did not choose.

Composes with `storage-proof`: durable-proof tasks keep routing to Claude for
the real-PostgreSQL egress a provider sandbox blocks. Module order matters —
`grok-implementer` must load after `storage-proof` (both override
`singular_select_l2_runner`; last one wins) — and the module documents this.
Covered by `singular-ext/tests/test-grok-implementer-selection.sh`.

### Recovery governance

The V9 recovery contract module is now fully frozen (14/14 objects `uchg`) and
its anchored verifier reports `verified-frozen`. The paused recovery lanes
resume against their pinned base under the V9 authority.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-08-11 — Quiet at full scale

The 68-node, 45-stage AXON plan exposed console problems that small fixtures
could not: navigation scrolled away, a lens rail consumed useful canvas, most
Timeline bars had no readable label, repeating Matrix lines overpowered the
data, and the Agents model picker offered no option for the model actually in
use. The console refinements do not change orchestration semantics or schema
shape; the pre-launch namespace cut below changes every product-facing
identity. `schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

### Singular is the only launch namespace

This pre-launch cut adopts Singular as the project's sole identity from top to
bottom: the `singular` executable, `SINGULAR_*` environment, config/version and
state paths, shell/Python symbols, schema and API ids, launchd service, browser
storage, plugin copy, tests, fixtures, documentation and product video all use
the same namespace.

The cut is intentionally clean. There is no alias, dual-read path or state
import layer for the pre-launch namespace replaced by this release. Each
consumer starts with `singular setup` and a freshly authored DAG; unrelated
machine-wide installations are left untouched.

### App navigation is static and always in reach

Home, Plan, Consoles and Agents now live as one static tab row in the top bar.
The row exists before a thread is selected, never moves under a thread, and
remains available when the thread registry is empty. The sidebar keeps plan
identity, Providers and its rail toggle; the toggle sits in the brand row and
both expanded and rail modes still navigate.

The retired breadcrumb does not take the stop explanation with it. One status
chip now composes two disjoint writers: execution owns `stopped` / `stop clear`,
and the plan store owns the actionable reason. At 560px all four surface tabs
remain distinct icon controls; health, stopped state and Refresh compact without
covering them, while titles and accessibility labels retain the full truth.

### Plan views lead the toolbar instead of taking a column

Timeline, Matrix, DAG and Tasks now lead the workbench toolbar as a horizontal
tablist, followed by search and filters. A dependency-free lens registry is
shared by the router and workbench, removing the duplicate lists that could
drift. The old 196px lens column is returned to the canvas, the drilldown remains
the grid's second column, and toolbar controls share a 28px rhythm. Arrow keys,
Home and End operate the tablist, including the empty-DAG Tasks fallback.

### Timeline labels the activity it draws

Visible bar labels use the numeric task suffix (`0041`), while the full task id
and title remain in the tooltip, accessible name and detail view. Label placement
can use any retry segment or a quiet outside gap. Before this pass 86 of 107 bar
segments had no label; in the final AXON window 32 of 37 distinct tasks have a
visible label.

Scale is driven by legibility: the median interval targets 56px, then yields to
an absolute full-canvas ceiling of eight pane widths. Compressed idle gaps share
a bounded width budget but remain individually represented. A ResizeObserver
recomputes the axis when the rail, drilldown or viewport changes and preserves
both scroll axes. Short runs become wider and easier to read; very long campaigns
can scroll farther until the cap binds.

Lane padding drops from 8px to 4px and area headers from 30px to 24px. Tasks with
no recorded node are not renamed away or hidden: each area shows an honest
`unattributed · N — no node recorded` disclosure, collapsed by default with a
heat trace and expandable by pointer or keyboard.

### Matrix structure is quieter and CSS-tunable

Default Matrix cells are borderless. Only stage boundaries receive the standard
one-pixel separator, structural sticky edges use the subtle hairline, and the
upper triangle uses a 45% sunken-surface wash instead of a hard stair-step fill.
The lens emits semantic boundary, wash, state, hover and failure attributes;
inline border/fill paint and repeating `--n-400` lines are gone.

### Agent model choices match the configured provider

Agents and Providers now share one provider-keyed model vocabulary, including
the full `gpt-5.6*` family. Agent model fields are native selects with the current
value prepended and deduplicated, so unknown values remain selectable instead of
being silently replaced. Providers retain their free-text inputs with the same
shared suggestions. The duplicate model datalist ids disappear.

The System settings model group now honours its role-matrix layout: one shared
model and service tier, followed by planner, worker and auditor reasoning. It
uses the existing dirty, validation and save path, and its subregions meet at
single hairlines rather than floating as cards.

### Follow-ups

Timeline filter wiring remains a separate pass. A future server-supplied model
catalog (`options[]` on `/api/settings` items) can replace the client fallback
vocabulary and the adjacent inference workarounds.

### Starting with Singular 0.18.0

Treat this as a new installation, not an in-place migration. Install the engine
under `SINGULAR_HOME` (default `~/.singular`), run `singular setup` in each
consumer, and author a fresh DAG. Singular does not read, alias or import
configuration, state, plans or archives from the pre-launch namespace replaced
by this release; those installations remain untouched.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-08-10 — Proof, not assumption

Two field reports, one release. The Spokit localization sessions found six
reliability defects; an AXON consumer session then took installed 0.16.0 into a
restricted sandbox and found ten more, plus two consumer-side observations.
They share a shape: the engine reported success it had not verified, or
reported a fact it had merely inferred. Cleanup that could not prove it worked
returned zero. A process that could not be inspected was called dead. A graph
that was parallel was drawn as a queue. Gates accepted last June were counted
as progress made today.

`schemaVersion` stays **v2**. Every contract change here is additive: new
schema files, new API fields, new environment knobs, new CLI verbs.

### A timed-out agent could outlive the kill that reported success

`singular_kill_tree` built its picture of the process tree from one `ps -A -o
pid= -o ppid=` call whose return code and stderr were discarded, inside a
heredoc wrapped in `2>/dev/null || true`. Where `ps` was denied — a restricted
sandbox, a hardened CI image — the child map came back empty, only the recorded
root was signalled, and the function returned 0. The descendants kept running,
kept writing to a worktree the engine believed it had reclaimed, and nothing
anywhere said so. The AXON session reproduced it as a clean-suite timeout case
where the direct child died and its grandchild did not.

Enumeration was never the right primary mechanism; it was the only one
available, because no runner had ever been given a session of its own. Each
provider now spawns through `singular_setsid_exec` as the last command of a
background job, so `$!` *is* the session leader — `pid == pgid`, held un-reaped
by the spawning shell, therefore unrecyclable. `singular_kill_tree` gained two
group modes: **proven** (`os.getpgid(root) == root`, not our own group, `> 1`)
and **asserted** (the lookup itself is denied, but the caller passed the literal
`session` argument and the group still answers). It never signals a negative pid
without one of those two proofs. TERM, a bounded grace, KILL, then a verify poll
that only accepts `ProcessLookupError` as death — EPERM counts as alive.
Enumeration survives as a fallback for descendants that deliberately `setsid`
away.

The part that matters most is the honesty: a cleanup that cannot be proven now
sets `SINGULAR_KILL_TREE_RESULT=degraded`, prints one `UNVERIFIED` line into
whatever log the runner is already writing, and emits a `kill.unverified` event.
One deliberate exception, argued rather than assumed: a group whose death *was*
verified while `ps` was denied reports `verified`, with an informational
`kill.enumeration_unavailable` event — degrading every kill in every restricted
sandbox would make the signal worthless. Tree mode keeps the strict rule.

`SINGULAR_SESSION_SPAWN=0` restores the old topology wholesale. The duplicate
`singular_claude_kill_tree` is gone. `ask`/`supervise`/`decide` deliberately do
*not* get a session — they `exec` their runner so a root TERM reaches its trap
chain, and an attended Ctrl-C still behaves.

### A process that could not be inspected was called a dead one

Doctor probed each pidfile with `os.kill(pid, 0)` under
`except (OSError, ValueError)` and called every failure a stale pidfile. Three
different facts collapsed into one verdict, and the wrong one is dangerous:
`EPERM` means the process may well exist and cannot be inspected. In the AXON
sandbox doctor called console PID 14763 stale while it was the live graph
server.

Four verdicts now, and a live PID is reported for the first time (it previously
produced no check at all). `unknown-permission` says what happened and, pointedly,
says not to delete the pidfile. This completes the tri-state work that landed in
`ops health` in the same cycle, so the two surfaces finally agree.

Doctor also grew the capability probes that should have existed before any of
this was trusted: `runtime.process-group-kill` actually spawns a session, kills
it, and verifies the group is gone — a hard failure, because after this release
group termination is the primary cleanup mechanism for every run — and
`runtime.process-enumeration` warns, since `ps` is now only a fallback. Doctor
diagnoses; enforcement lives where unattended work actually starts, so
`autonomate` runs the same preflight after claiming its pidfile and exits 2
rather than dispatching workers it could not clean up. `SINGULAR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_KILL=1`
overrides for operators who accept the risk. Attended commands are never gated.

### A parallel plan drawn as a single queue

The DAG lens grouped nodes by `stage`, gave each stage a column, and computed
depth **only from dependencies whose source and target shared a stage**. AXON
uses a distinct stage per milestone, so every cross-stage edge was dropped from
layout and 44 nodes rendered as one horizontal rail. The dependency data was
correct the whole time — `collect_dag_view` emitted every edge, and the lens's
own ancestry walk used all of them. Only the placement lied. The server made it
worse by ordering stages on a `D`-prefix-then-numeric-suffix key, which could
draw a node to the left of its own prerequisite.

Layout is now dependency-ranked: a new dependency-free `dag_layout.js` computes
Kahn longest-path ranks over every `dependsOn` edge, equal-rank nodes share a
wave, and lanes within a wave order deterministically by `(area, id)`. Stages
sort topologically, with the old key demoted to a tie-break so familiar plans
keep their familiar order. Stage ribbons retired in favour of a wave ruler —
under rank columns a stage's nodes are no longer contiguous, and a ribbon
spanning them would be a second lie. Cycles are tolerated rather than fatal: the
render survives and `validate.ok` already reports the real problem.

Node status gained the distinctions an operator actually needs — ready now,
blocked by dependency, blocked by a human gate, running, historically complete —
and three live bugs fell out along the way: `passed-with-acknowledged-baseline`
had been classified as queued, an active L1 lease rendered as queued, and the
frontier arm was dead code because the server always emits a status string.

### Thirteen gates from June, counted as this campaign's progress

The workbench reported `30% — 13 / 44 DAG nodes gated complete` while the loop
was stopped and the new plan had never been actuated. Every one of those gates
was legitimate: AXON deliberately preserved thirteen authoritative results from
late June, marked `evidenceClass: grandfathered`. The number was true and the
sentence it formed was false — an operator could reasonably conclude the run had
already executed work, or that STOP had failed, or that green gates had been
manufactured during setup.

Progress now splits into cohorts derived from the provenance already on disk:
`historical accepted 13/13`, `current campaign 0/31`, with the combined figure
demoted to secondary. The derivation is server-side and emitted in the API only.
Writing a `campaign` field into the gate files would have meant a schema bump, a
migration, and rewriting the hashes of authoritative historical records — which
is precisely what AXON preserved them to avoid.

### "Connected" is not "running", and a stopped loop should say why

The sidebar labelled the current plan `live` with a green dot while the status
bar correctly read `loop stopped · 0 active · 0 ready`. In the code `live` meant
"you are looking at the live repo rather than an archived plan" — a data-source
flag wearing execution vocabulary. It now reads `connected`, and running/stopped
language belongs exclusively to the surfaces that know about execution. A stop
reason rides alongside the plan title: `Stopped — operator approval required for
G100`, derived from a pending human gate on a dependency-ready node.

Relatedly, safe serialization used to look like a broken scheduler. The engine
deliberately refuses to plan two nodes in the same area concurrently, so AXON's
four-wide wave runs three — correct, and invisible. A read-only replica of
`singular_select_l1_frontier` now runs in the console and surfaces
`ready 4 · runnable 3 · cap 3` with the reason per node (`mcp area already
selected`). The replica declares its own coverage in a `policy` list: the
pending-promotion pre-filter is deliberately not modelled, because the console's
task projection cannot reproduce supersession chains and guessing would produce
confidently wrong exclusions. Its rules are pinned case by case against the bash
implementation by `NativeL1SelectionTests`, and were additionally checked
differentially against the extracted original during development.

### Setup was a sequence you had to already know

Bringing a consumer repo to a safe state required reasoning separately about
repository pin versus installed engine, v0 versus v2 schema, preservation of
authoritative historical gates, STOP ownership across two state roots, migration
behaviour, doctor evidence, and the difference between approving a migration and
approving actuation. None of that is discoverable, and getting the order wrong
is destructive.

`singular setup` is one idempotent command that performs or explains every step.
The verb is `setup`, not the field report's `bootstrap`, because `bootstrap`
already means per-worktree dependency install in four places including a doctor
check id. Prerequisites fail before any mutation. **STOP is the first repo
write** — before the pin, before the scaffold, before the migration — and setup
never removes it. Gate results are hashed and parsed into a snapshot before
migration and verified after it *semantically*, because `v0-to-v1` legitimately
rewrites gate bytes when it rebrands namespaces; a byte delta is informational,
a changed status is `SINGULAR_GATE_PRESERVATION_FAILED`. The run ends on an
explicit ladder — `installed → migrated → validated → stopped-ready`, where
`stopped-ready` requires migration, verified gates, a passing doctor *and* a
recorded passing regression run — and prints exactly one `Next:` line. No
`approve-actuation` verb was invented; setup routes to the human-gate surfaces
that already exist. Actuation remains a separate, explicit operator action.

Every failure carries a stable code and one recovery instruction, as
`singular.operator-failure.v0`; `--json` emits exactly one object and the human
block leads with the same code, so the two can never name different problems.

Three supporting fixes make that command trustworthy. Bash selection is now one
shared guard (`engine/bash-guard.sh`) that probes a candidate interpreter before
exec'ing it and carries a loop guard — the regression harness, the installer and
the migrations had no guard at all, and the CLI only re-exec'd when
`SINGULAR_BASH_BIN` was already set, so a bare macOS `/bin/bash` walked straight
into cryptic failures. A pin or schema mismatch is now one primary diagnosis
instead of a cascade: `schema.version` carries
`details.code = SINGULAR_SCHEMA_MISMATCH` and blocks the seventeen checks that
merely reinterpret repo artifacts, each recording `blockedBy` so the audit trail
survives, while every environmental check keeps answering for real. And running
the suite from a Git archive is refused once, up front, instead of failing
every dependent test separately.

### A suite that outlived the session that started it

The original clean-suite run kept going after the agent that launched it stopped
reporting. The next session could not tell whether to start another suite,
attach to the existing one, or treat the silence as failure — and `tests/run.sh`
could not have answered: no lock, no manifest, no per-test logs, no exit record.

`singular test` supervises the run. A detached supervisor holds an `flock` for its
entire life, so liveness is proven by the kernel rather than inferred from a PID
that may have been recycled or may merely be uninspectable — the same class of
mistake as the pidfile bug above, refused by construction. Probers take a
**shared** lock: with an exclusive probe two concurrent readers would block each
other and both conclude "running", a false positive on exactly the question this
command exists to answer. A run persists a `singular.test-run.v0` manifest, full
suite log, per-test logs and a progress stream under
`.singular-state/test-runs/<runId>/`. A second invocation attaches instead of
duplicating. A supervisor killed mid-run reconciles to `interrupted` — and reaps
the run's process group, since an orphaned suite would otherwise keep appending
to a run the manifest had already closed.

`tests/run.sh` keeps its default *output* byte-for-byte and remains directly
invocable as this repository's own gate command; the logging hooks are additive,
and the two new preflights (Bash and Git source) can refuse up front where it
previously walked into a cascade.

### Two settings, one value, and no warning

`singular_json_config_to_env` emits structured configuration first and the legacy
`env{}` map last, so a later duplicate silently wins. AXON's config asked for
`resources.maxConcurrent: 3` and `SINGULAR_MAX_CONCURRENT: "2"`; it got two, and
nothing said which had won or that there had been a contest. A new
`config.source-conflict` check runs the real generator and inspects its emission
order rather than reimplementing the mapping — so it covers the whole shadowable
surface and cannot rot as fields are added — and names the key, both values,
both sources and the effective winner.

### From the Spokit sessions

Six reliability fixes from the same cycle. The auditor contract is now exact and
a schema-invalid verdict is retried with a bounded repair prompt carrying the
validator error and the rejected output, instead of a blind retry of an
unchanged prompt. `commands[].cmd` must contain only executable shell text —
a field failure had embedded `(attempt-2 green: 40 pass, 0 fail)` into a command
that was then handed to `bash -c` — with quote- and escape-aware rejection that
still permits real shell comments. Planner backoff is scoped to the provider that
earned it, proven by canonical adapter identity so a custom wrapper named
`codex-run.sh` cannot impersonate the shipped one, and switching providers no
longer inherits another provider's penalty. A parsed top-level Codex completion
event starts a bounded shutdown grace, and a later terminal failure still
overrides to a nonzero exit with its evidence intact. Concurrency adapts to
validated provider pressure — clustered, schema-validated, hash-bound 429 and
overload evidence only, never log prose or a self-declared failure class — with
provider-scoped durable state, additive recovery, a floor of one, and no state
file at all when disabled.

### Migrating from 0.16.0

Nothing is required. `schemaVersion` stays v2, every new *tuning* knob defaults
to previous behaviour, and `autonomate.alive` keeps its meaning for existing
JSON consumers (`null` now expresses the previously unrepresentable EPERM case).
The two knobs that do not are the rollback switches for the behaviour changes
below.

Two behaviour changes are worth knowing. Providers now run in their own session,
so a SIGKILL of a runner orphans a provider session that the old topology would
have left as a plain child; the durable session record exists to make that
reapable, and `SINGULAR_SESSION_SPAWN=0` reverts the topology entirely. And
`autonomate` refuses to start where process-group cleanup cannot be verified —
run `singular doctor` to see the capability verdict, or set
`SINGULAR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_KILL=1` to accept the risk deliberately.

The regression suite ships only in engine checkouts, because it requires Git
history and disposable worktrees; `singular test` says so up front rather than
starting a run that cannot succeed.

---

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-26 — Say what is wrong

The remaining findings from the same 26-node program. 0.15.1 fixed things the
engine knew and discarded; these are things the engine could see and never said.
Each cost an operator hours not because the state was unrecoverable but because
the report was indistinguishable from a healthy one.

`schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

### Parallel L1 planners were invisible

`run-status.sh` keys its record on the run id alone
(`$SINGULAR_RUNS_DIR/$run_id/run-status.json`), and L0's fanout hands every
concurrent planner the **same** origin run id. N planners therefore raced on one
file, last writer wins, and `singular health` could never report more than
`phases: 1` however many were running. An operator watching `phases: 1` against
`leases l1=2` mid-incident learned to distrust the phase counter.

The 0.15.1 handoff attributed this to a shallow scan (`runs.glob("*/…")` finding
only direct children). It is not: the records were never written separately in
the first place, and deepening the glob would have fixed nothing while breaking
the console's `runId == <dirname>` guard. Each planner now derives its own status
id, exactly as `integrate.sh` already does per task, so the record lands as a
direct child of `runs/` and **no scan changes anywhere**. Both layers that write
planner status — `l1-plan-node.sh` and `generate-tasks.sh`, which inherits the
origin id through `SINGULAR_PLANNING_RUN_ID` — derive the same id, so one planner
still means one record.

### A fresh consumer graph could not promote anything, and did not say so

Two defensible defaults combine into a dead graph: the shipped promoter promotes
only nodes in its own registry — ids from one specific consumer project — and
`authority` defaults to `operator` for evaluation nodes. Worse, the frontier-mode
skip was **silent**: `unsupported gate promotion node:` is guarded by strict
mode, which frontier mode disables, so the only symptom was `promotion: no
promotable frontier gates` every iteration — the same line a merely not-yet-ready
frontier prints. That cost a consumer a full day before they wrote their own
promoter.

Both remedies already existed and neither was discoverable. The `promoter` config
key is now in the starter config and the README; a `graph.promotability` doctor
check names the unregistered nodes and the operator-only evaluation nodes
separately, with both remedies; and the frontier skip now reports which nodes it
skipped and why.

The check asks the promoter whether it registers a node (`--registers`, a pure
query that takes no origin lock and creates nothing) rather than reimplementing
its registry — but **only for the promoter we ship**. A consumer promoter takes a
bare NODE argument, so probing an unknown one could be read as a node id and make
it *act*; a diagnostic must never promote anything, so an unrecognised promoter
is reported as unintrospectable instead.

### One contract violation per run, each hiding the next

`dag.sh`'s `fail()` prints and exits. That is right for the loop — a frontier
read must not act on an invalid gate — but it means a promoter under development
learns about exactly one violation per run. A consumer hit four in sequence
(absolute `evidence[].ref`, absolute `gateReportRef`, a task-set hashed by their
own convention, a `taskId` that did not match `^TASK-[0-9]{4,}$`), each hidden by
the one before, each costing a loop restart.

`singular gate validate FILE` reports them together. `fail()` gained a collecting
mode that records and raises instead of exiting, and the independent units —
each evidence item, the report schema, the log refs and hashes, the baseline, the
command-log binding, the task-set binding — now report side by side. Collecting
is opt-in and every existing subcommand is unchanged: `next-areas` still stops at
the first breach, which is pinned by its own test.

Coverage is deliberately honest rather than total: checks that genuinely cannot
proceed (an unreadable gate file, a missing `gateReportRef`) still stop that
branch, because everything after them would be noise.

---

## [0.15.1] — 2026-07-25 — What the engine already knew

Three defects from the same 26-node localization program, all one shape: **the
engine had the right information and threw it away.** It classified a 529 as
transient and then treated it as a usage limit. It hashed a gate log correctly
and cited it in a form its own validator must reject. It produced a precise DAG
diagnostic and sent it to `/dev/null`.

`schemaVersion` stays **v2**.

### A transient 529 cost 30 idle minutes

The provider-error classifier gets 503/529 right — `kind = "overloaded"`,
`retryable = true` — and the next statement discarded it, bucketing `overloaded`
with `usage-limit` and `entitlement` into one `quota` class. That selected
`SINGULAR_PLANNER_QUOTA_BACKOFF_SECONDS` (1800), and because autonomate's quota
nap `continue`s past `reconcile`, **a capacity blip that clears in seconds idled
the entire graph for half an hour** — not just planning. At six concurrent
agents it was the dominant failure mode.

The obvious fix is wrong. Bucketing overload as quota was buying something real:
those refusals do not increment the circuit breaker. Demote `overloaded` to
`provider-exit` and five 529s in a row halt the loop — strictly worse.

So there is now a third class, `provider-overloaded`: the same no-breaker
sleep-through, an order of magnitude shorter
(`SINGULAR_PLANNER_OVERLOAD_BACKOFF_SECONDS`, default 180), with its own
`SINGULAR_OVERLOAD_WAIT_BUDGET` (3600) so a burst of 529s cannot spend the
usage-limit allowance and stop the loop for a reason that was never a usage
limit.

Two things the class alone did not fix:

- **The breaker chokepoint hardcoded `quota`** when re-arming from cycle
  evidence, so an overload window bought the 30-minute backoff there even once
  the classifier told the truth. It now reads the class from the evidence's
  `kind`.
- **`failureClass` and the provider-error `kind` were never cross-checked.**
  `failureClass` is written by the host classifier; `kind` comes from the
  separately hash-bound sidecar. A runner-result that merely *claimed* `quota`
  over a 529 envelope was the cheap way to buy a 30-minute sleep-through. The
  two must now agree — checked against the *declared* class, which also closes
  the `any` query the cycle scanner uses.

### `evidenceClass: deterministic-proof` was unreachable

`gate-check.sh` built its refs from `SINGULAR_STATE_DIR`, which is absolute, and
`gate_report.py` writes `--log-ref` verbatim. `dag.sh`'s `safe_repo_artifact`
rejects an absolute ref **before** it checks anything else. So no gate report the
engine produced could ever back a `deterministic-proof` gate-result — regardless
of hashes, integrity or outcome. A consumer found this by writing a promoter,
correctly refused to rewrite the engine's report to work around it ("that would
mean editing evidence"), and fell back to a weaker class.

The validator did not change — it is a trust boundary and must keep refusing
absolute paths. Neither did `gate_report.py`, whose `--log-ref` / `--log-path`
split was already the right seam. **One caller was wrong**, and it now
relativizes against `SINGULAR_ROOT` (never `$PWD` — gate checks run inside a
worktree), leaving the path absolute when the state dir genuinely lives outside
the repo rather than fabricating a ref that resolves to nothing.

That exposed the real hazard: **a relative `logRef` means three different things
in this repo** — resolved against `SINGULAR_ROOT` by `dag.sh`, against the *run
directory* by `evidence-manifest.sh`, and against the *report's own directory* by
`gate-report.py`. Making the citation repo-relative silently broke the other two:
gate checks downgraded to `inconclusive`, and the audit path reported an
unreadable gate log, which becomes `audit-infra`, which the decider parks
unconditionally — **a passing gate would have parked the task.** Reports now also
carry `logPath`, the file that was actually opened and hashed, and every reader
that needs to *open* the log follows it. Only `dag.sh` reads `logRef`, and only
it defines the repo-relative meaning.

The regression test drives `gate-check.sh` → `dag.sh` for real. Every prior
strict test either hand-wrote its report with a repo-relative `logRef` or drove
`promote-gate.sh`, which already passed a relative one — which is exactly how a
total, structural failure stayed invisible.

### A DAG validation error presented as "no work to do"

`dag.sh` emits a precise diagnostic and exits 2. Five call sites piped it to
`/dev/null` and reported an empty frontier, so one malformed gate file was
indistinguishable from an idle graph — 34 minutes of a field run spent reading
`frontier=0` while three nodes were ready.

`singular_dag_next_areas_json` now captures stderr, warns, and emits
`dag.evaluation_failed` (throttled per distinct diagnostic, so the per-cycle
frontier read cannot flood the event log while a *changed* error still reports).
It stays non-fatal: the loop keeps dispatching, integrating and reaping. It just
may not do it silently. `singular health` prints `UNEVALUABLE` instead of a count,
and a new `dag.evaluation` doctor check reports the diagnostic and what to do
about it.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-25 — The seams

0.14.1 shipped clean by every internal measure. Then a real 26-node workload ran
against it for 25 hours and produced **1 integrated task and 0 of 26 completed
nodes**. Nothing in the suite was wrong; the defects all live at seams the suite
never crossed — where the worker worktree must match the audit worktree, where a
read-only agent meets the operator's live repo, where an environmental fault
meets a retry budget, and where a parked task meets recovery and finds none.

`schemaVersion` stays **v2**: upgrading from 0.13.0+ is drop-in.

### The read-only guard destroyed work

Five runners carried a guard that snapshotted two lists of **paths** before a
read-only run and diffed them after. A list of paths cannot describe a state you
want to return to, and it was wrong in four separate ways because of it:

- a file already dirty before the run was in the "before" list, so the diff saw
  no change when the agent overwrote it — **the agent's write survived**;
- the only restore source was HEAD, so any file it did revert **lost whatever
  uncommitted work was in it**, including work written by somebody else;
- `git checkout -- <path>` restores from the index, so `git add` was a bypass;
- untracked files that appeared mid-run were `rm -rf`'d.

That last one was not hypothetical. Read-only runs execute against
`$SINGULAR_ROOT` for up to 1200s (`decide`), 900s (`supervise`) and 600s (`ask`)
while `autonomate.sh` keeps importing task files into `docs/orchestration/tasks`
in that same directory. **The engine was periodically deleting its own freshly
imported control state.**

The guard is content-addressed now (`engine/readonly_guard.py`): it captures the
exact bytes and index entry of everything already dirty, and afterwards puts
every changed path back to *what it was*, not to HEAD. It is also never
destructive — every byte it removes or overwrites is copied to a quarantine
directory first — and it stays out of engine-owned directories entirely, so the
concurrent-writer case cannot arise. Paths are handled null-delimited with
`:(literal)` pathspecs; the old guard silently no-op'd on any path git would
quote, which for a localization program is most of them.

It also now runs on the paths that mattered. `ask`/`supervise`/`decide`
SIGKILLed on timeout, and the guard was straight-line code after the run, so on
every timeout it never executed at all. `singular_kill_tree` takes a grace period
(`SINGULAR_KILL_GRACE_SEC`, default 10) and the guard moved into each runner's
EXIT trap. SIGKILL stays uncoverable, so `singular reconcile` sweeps the journals
killed runs leave behind, `gc` ages them out, and `doctor` reports pending ones.

**In-run restrictions are hardened too**, rather than leaning on cleanup:
`opencode` passed *nothing* for a read-only run and now uses `--agent plan`;
`claude` denies state-mutating git through Bash, the one mutation class a
post-run restore cannot repair (the guard restores the working tree — it does
not move HEAD back).

### The audit worktree was not the worker's worktree

Three sites built worktrees three different ways. The auditor re-runs the gate
whose result accepts or rejects the work, **in the one worktree that never
received `prewarm`** — while the worker that produced the green result did. From
outside, a gate that passes for the worker and fails for the auditor is
indistinguishable from the work being wrong.

`singular_worktree_prepare` is now the only way a worktree becomes runnable, for
all three sites. Dependency copies are a first-class `worktreeCopyPaths` config
key that **extends** the `node_modules` default instead of replacing it (a
monorepo declaring a nested path silently lost the root one), and a declared
path that does not exist is reported instead of skipped in silence.

### An environment failure spent the whole retry budget

The engine's "the gate could not run" log heuristics lived in
`engine/gate-report.py` — a module the v2 normalizer never calls. On v2, which
is every current consumer, they were dead code: any gate that exited non-zero
without an adapter observation became a **product** failure. A worktree missing
its dependencies read as a code defect, and the decider spent the entire budget
asking a model to fix code that was never broken. That is TASK-0006: five
attempts at a byte-identical head SHA against a TS2688 no edit could fix.

Patterns now live in `engine/infra-patterns.tsv`, shared by both modules, with a
**scope column** — only signatures application code cannot plausibly produce
reach the v2 path, because an infrastructure verdict parks a task
unconditionally and a false positive there is fatal rather than merely wasteful.

- **No-progress guard.** An attempt that reproduces the previous one exactly —
  same head, same uncommitted diff, same failure — parks immediately instead of
  burning the budget on a rerun that cannot differ.
- **`singular unpark TASK-XXXX`.** A transient fault used to kill a task
  permanently: the only operator verb was `supersede`, which buries the task
  rather than repairing it. `unpark` restores Status, lease status, the
  **retryCount** nothing else ever resets, and the refusals counter.
- **`escalate-infra`.** The decider had no way to say "the work is fine, the
  environment is not"; the nearest action was terminal and meant something else.
- **Gate timeout.** `SINGULAR_GATE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 3600). There was no
  bound at all: one hung gate held a worker slot forever and made cooperative
  STOP never fire. A terminated gate no longer fabricates a product failure —
  the 124/137/143 branch existed but was evaluated after the fabricated
  signature, so it had never once been reached.
- **Atomic single-instance guard.** `autonomate` claimed its pidfile
  check-then-write; it is `mkdir`-atomic now and records process identity, so a
  recycled pid can no longer lock the loop out permanently. `wake` says plainly
  that it un-halts a stopped loop, and takes `--keep-stop`.
- **`bootstrap.required: true` with no commands** is a promise that guarantees
  nothing; `doctor` warns, and the template stops shipping it.
- **`singular init` scaffolds a gate adapter** and the README documents
  `infrastructureFailure`. Neither existed, which is why no consumer emitted one.
- **`tests/test-grok-run.sh`** — grok had shipped with no tests at all. Writing
  them found its timeout killed only the direct child, orphaning descendants.

---

## [0.14.1] — 2026-07-25 — A passing gate passes

Two fixes for the same class of defect: things that worked for this repo and
broke for everyone else.

- **A passing gate no longer parks the task.** `schemaVersion: v2` implied
  `--require-observation` for every gate, and `gate_report.py` raises on a
  missing observation *before* it reads the exit code — so a green test suite
  normalized to `inconclusive-infrastructure`, which maps to `audit-infra`,
  which the decider parks **unconditionally** (it does not consult the retry
  budget: a model cannot fix broken infrastructure).

  Nothing shipped or documented an emitter for that sidecar — not the README,
  not `doctor`, and not the scaffold, whose suggested gate is
  `npm test && npm run build`. So `singular init` produced a repo in which every
  task parked on a passing gate, reported as an infrastructure fault with no
  actionable cause. The engine only worked on itself because the same commit
  that added the requirement also taught `tests/run.sh` to satisfy it.

  The observation is now required only where it does real work — reconciling a
  registered `gate-baseline.v0` — which `gate_report.py` enforces itself, with a
  better message. It bought nothing elsewhere: a green gate has no failures to
  classify, and a red gate without a report is already covered by the
  `gate-command-nonzero-without-report` signature.

- **A missing optional payload no longer aborts `install.sh`.** `copy()` is
  written as `[[ -e ... ]] && cp`, declaring items optional, but under `set -e` a
  missing one returned 1 and killed the script mid-loop — leaving a
  half-populated `versions/<ver>` while `current` still pointed at the previous
  release, and reporting it only through an exit code most callers discard. An
  empty, untracked `promoters/` directory (git cannot track empty directories, so
  nothing recorded its existence) was enough to take the whole install down after
  copying `engine/` and `schemas/`.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-25 — Console reliability, observability and redaction

Remediates the console-side half of the 2026-07-24 field report. (Its engine
findings — free-text quota scanning, auditor cache writes, model-cache errors —
were already fixed in 0.13.0; that audit ran against a live 0.11.1 daemon.)

### Security

- The console redacts credential-shaped content from **every** text-emitting
  endpoint: session logs (raw mode included), `/api/sessions` peeks, prompts,
  raw records, events, and ask answers. Patterns are shared with
  `engine/secret-scan.sh` through the new `engine/secret-patterns.tsv`, so the
  commit gate and the browser cannot drift to two notions of "looks like a
  secret". The motivating leak was concrete: the gate quotes an offending line
  into `secret-scan.log`, which is in `PLAIN_LOG_NAMES` and streamed verbatim.
- `/api/raw/config` masks `singular.config.json` `env{}` values whose key names
  denote credentials, keeping the keys so the Providers model knobs still work.
- Rules are anchored, never entropy-based: 40-hex git SHAs and 64-hex artifact
  hashes are legitimate content here and are deliberately left intact.
- `SINGULAR_CONSOLE_REDACT=0` disables it; `/api/health` reports the state so a
  disabled control cannot be silently off.
- `/api/state` no longer ships `autonomateTail` — 80 raw loop-stdout lines on
  every 10s poll, with no consumer anywhere in `plugin/`.

### Correctness

- Provider resolution is shared with the engine via `engine/provider_resolver.py`
  (the python twin of `singular_resolve_codex_bin`, pinned by
  `tests/test-provider-resolver-parity.sh`). The console reads
  `SINGULAR_CODEX_BIN` from config `env{}` as the engine does, and a configured
  but broken path now reports `misconfigured` instead of silently falling back
  to a different PATH binary.
- Planner sessions report `accepted` / `rejected` / `failed` / `empty` from the
  critique verdict and import events. A batch critique rejected used to report
  `integrated`, painting the same green as a live session.
- `SINGULAR_SUPERVISOR_INTERVAL_MIN` is a real setting. Home's "enable
  auto-briefing" button POSTed a key no whitelist contained, so it always failed.
- `boolValue` is recomputed when config `env{}` overlays a bool, so the System
  panel no longer shows the opposite of the truth for `SINGULAR_AUTO_INTEGRATE`,
  `SINGULAR_PUSH`, `SINGULAR_GENERATE` and `SINGULAR_ENABLE_L1_PARALLEL`.
- The status dock takes both task counts from one payload block with one
  revision, instead of composing "active" and "ready" from two sources with two
  definitions — which is how one task rendered as "1 active · 1 ready".
- `doctor` maps `resources.maxConcurrent` to `SINGULAR_MAX_CONCURRENT`, the
  variable reconcile actually reads (it was evaluating the L1 planner cap, which
  governs no worktrees).

### Operability

- Low disk is now a declared mode: reconcile suspends planning and dispatch,
  emits `origin.degraded_low_disk`, and says so on stdout. Integration,
  promotion, imports and snapshots keep running — deliberately *not* shaped like
  the STOP downgrade, which would skip the very work that reclaims disk.
- The Plan timeline renders L0 cycles and gates when no task has been imported
  yet. Two independent causes: it bailed on an empty task list, and the cycle
  strip was painted underneath the opaque sticky axis, so it had never been
  visible at all.
- The Consoles left feed is labelled "Origin events" — it is the origin event
  stream, not a supervisor session.

### Behavior changes worth knowing

- A stale `SINGULAR_CODEX_BIN` now surfaces as a red `misconfigured` provider
  card rather than a green-ish one describing the wrong executable.
- Log output in the browser shows `[redacted:<kind>]` tokens where credentials
  used to appear.
- `split-task` remains a semantic park: it marks the task blocked and generates
  nothing. The follow-up task observed in the field was the ordinary planner
  re-planning on the next cycle. Task-complexity scoring is deferred.

### Also fixed

- `claude-run.sh` created its strict-profile MCP config with a `mktemp` template
  ending in `.json`. BSD/macOS `mktemp` substitutes only *trailing* X's, so it
  produced a file named literally `singular-claude-empty-mcp.XXXXXX.json`. That
  works once — the EXIT trap removes it — but any hard kill leaves the literal
  name behind and every later strict Claude run dies with `mkstemp failed: File
  exists`. A leaked temp file became a permanent, silent provider outage. Now a
  `mktemp -d` with trailing X's, and `test-capability-runtime.sh` plants the
  leaked artifacts so the path is exercised with one present.

Suites: bash 178, python 242.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-07-24 — Operational resilience and governance

- Adaptive worktree scheduling now accounts for free space, reserve, and
  estimated worktree cost, with one conservative garbage-collection retry and
  the calculation exposed in health output.
- Added contained, lockfile-bound worktree bootstrap; structured `doctor`
  coverage; and owner-, answer-, expiry-, evidence-, and artifact-hash-bound
  human gates whose descendants remain blocked whenever approval becomes stale.
- Disabled artifact-unbound accept-waivers in schema v2; they remain available
  only through the explicit `legacyCompatibility.unboundWaivers` switch.
- Advanced the consumer contract to `schemaVersion: v2`, with an idempotent
  v1→v2 migration, authoritative schema-mirror synchronization, additive
  configuration defaults, dual-read compatibility for existing v0 records,
  and validation-preserving support for consumer-only schema extensions.
- Added a non-destructive release-promotion canary for the captured 26-node
  localization graph and all ten field-report regression scenarios.
- Added strict `SINGULAR_CODEX_BIN` resolution shared by doctor and the Codex
  runner. Doctor now spawns the selected CLI with bounded `--version` and
  authentication probes, catching broken packaged native executables.
- Added bootstrap-only `SINGULAR_BASH_BIN` so Bash ≥4 can be selected without
  reordering `PATH`; launchd keeps deprecated `CODEX_BIN` as a fallback alias.
- Active non-quota planner backoffs now defer replanning without creating L1
  leases or repeatedly incrementing the circuit breaker. Imports,
  integrations, ready dispatches, and unrelated failure accounting continue.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-24 — Evidence and operator clarity

- Added bounded, hash-addressed evidence manifests and raw-artifact access;
  role/capability profiles; atomic lifecycle status; grouped structured
  diagnostics; and strict baseline-bound gate reports.
- Auditor prompts consume the compact manifest by default, while raw evidence
  remains separately hash-verifiable and subject to composed, excerpt,
  retrieval, and token-canary budgets.
- `gate-result.v1` now carries the four verification classifications, rehashes
  every referenced artifact at frontier evaluation, and requires a fully bound
  gate report for deterministic passes. `audit-verdict.v1` classifications are
  host-bound so evidence-only verification cannot be upgraded to a rerun pass.

## [0.11.2] — 2026-07-24 — Immediate stabilization

- Plan revision now shares host-side task-batch extraction and validation with
  initial planning, preserves task identity, and replaces staged candidates
  only after complete validation through an atomic immutable-generation pointer
  (including interruption and concurrent-reader coverage), without extending
  the runner contract with `--stage-dir`.
- Provider backoff now requires validated provider-owned terminal envelopes;
  auditor verification uses disposable writable worktrees and hash-bound
  classifications; durable control transitions commit immediately while idle
  snapshots default to a 300-second interval.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-07-19 — Thread sub-menu; home flicker fix

- **IA**: the header surface-tab row is gone — Home / Plan / Consoles / Agents
  are now a vertical sub-menu nested under the ACTIVE thread in the sidebar
  (tree rail, 31px rows, existing-sprite icons, icon-only in rail mode; the
  consoles live badge rides along). Breadcrumb extends to
  `repo › thread › Surface`.
- **fix**: Home no longer flickers — dag/sessions events fed a signature
  bypass that rebuilt the page every ~2s and replayed the `arrive` entrance;
  live-session fields now fold into the signature, `arrive` plays only on
  route entry, chat bubbles animate only on first paint (CDP-verified: 10
  identical rebuilds per 20s → 0).
- **fix**: console answers HEAD probes for `/` and `/api/health` (was 501).

Suites: bash 157, python 206.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-19 — Quiet Instrument: console design-language overhaul

Visual/IA polish pass adopting the Singular "Quiet Instrument" design system
(normative spec: layered warm near-whites, hairline structure, ≤5% semantic
color, honest states). No engine behavior changes; one additive API field.

### Shell
- Full-height chrome rail (`#f7f6f3`) with the brand block moved into the
  sidebar; stage header gains a `repo › thread` breadcrumb; surface tabs
  restyled as a segmented control (white raised active pill).
- New persistent 32px **status dock** spanning the full width: loop cell
  (running / engine busy / stopped), active·ready tasks, gates, attention
  ("N needs you", ochre when nonzero), breaker (only when tripped), codex
  quota (hidden when unavailable), repo·branch, conn + updated age.
  Historical mode swaps the left cluster for "viewing archived plan" +
  back-to-live.
- Tokens reconciled to the Quiet Instrument palette with every legacy alias
  preserved (`--surface-*`, `--border-*`, `--tone-*`, `--n-*` remapped);
  coral retires → lavender (special/evaluation). Global `:focus-visible`
  ring, `::selection`, tabular numerals, `arrive`/`calm-pulse` keyframes,
  reduced-motion killswitch.

### Surfaces
- Home: card grammar (paper, hairline, radius 14–16, 42px headers, dashed
  action footers), calm sage "All clear" walk-away state, supervisor chat
  re-patterned to the AI-thread archetype (dark right-aligned user block,
  open-prose assistant with ink glyph + quiet provenance row), composer as a
  white radius-16 card with circular ink send, 3px steel quota/gauge tracks.
- Providers: interactive paper cards (hover border+shadow), 7px status dots
  with explicit words, tone-pair chips, lavender DEFAULT RUNNER badge.
- Consoles: the one routine dark surface formalized — `--term-*` island
  tokens, `#27272a` pane title bars with traffic dots, mint streaming cursor;
  recent rail as nav rows; light chrome around it.
- Plan: dotted-grid DAG canvas with running-node ring, lens nav rows +
  eyebrow, 36px muted table headers, filter-chip/quickfilter recipes,
  matrix Follow-diagonal adopts the shared button recipes.
- Agents: card grammar, 34px inputs, segmented toggles, tone-pair chips.

### Fixes
- Snapshot payload gains additive `loop: {pid, alive}` (autonomate pidfile +
  signal-0) so the dock never reads test-suite processes as the loop
  "running" (agents.l0.state counts processes; the dock now labels that
  state "engine busy").
- Terminal-island + shared grays tokenized (mechanical sweep; opencode k3
  was attempted twice and produced no edits — applied deterministically).

Suites: bash 157 (+ DOM shell test), python 203.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-18 — App shell (threads sidebar), matrix rebuild, provider quotas, supervisor briefing + chat

Four requests in one release, moving the console from viewer toward platform:
a two-level app shell (plan threads in a left sidebar, surfaces become
thread-scoped tabs), a rebuilt dependency matrix, subscription-quota gauges on
Home, and a supervisor presence — a periodic read-only briefing plus a
propose-only chat. `schemaVersion` stays **v1**; every engine addition is
byte-inert until its knob is set (a no-config reconcile cycle creates zero
supervisor artifacts).

### Console — app shell (left sidebar + plan threads)
- The four surfaces become **thread-scoped tabs** behind the slim header
  (Home, Plan, Consoles, Agents); a new **left sidebar** holds the plan-
  threads list (the live plan, highlighted, plus archived read-only threads —
  name · date · gates P/T) and an **app-level nav** into which **Providers
  moves out of the tab row**. Clicking an archived thread reloads into
  `?plan=` historical mode; "Current plan" returns to live.
- The rail collapses (persisted in localStorage; auto-rail under 1100px), and
  both navs drive `showSurface` with mirrored `aria-pressed`. The old header
  plan-switcher `<select>` is gone. Zero route/server changes — all asset
  hashes for the untouched modules are unaffected.

### Console — dependency matrix rebuilt
- **Sticky** column headers, row labels, and the top-left corner stay pinned
  (opaque) while scrolling. Row labels are now **readable two lines** (title
  over id) instead of the mono id bleeding under the title — fixes the
  id-overlap bug on names like `metrics-extract`.
- **Height-aware fit:** cell size is the min of the width- and height-fit
  (clamped 22–44px); when the grid fits an axis it centers on it.
- **Follow-diagonal scrolling** (toggle, persisted, default on): scrolling
  right walks the matrix down in lockstep so the gate-status diagonal stays in
  view; the y-axis stays free and the toolbar toggle decouples the axes. The
  floating detail card now stays in the pane corner instead of scrolling
  offscreen when the grid is taller than the pane.

### Engine + Console — supervisor briefing & ask
- New engine `engine/supervise.sh` (`--once`) and `engine/ask.sh` run a
  **read-only one-shot runner** over a state digest (STATUS.md, health,
  frontier, gates, recent events, config env{}, settings whitelist).
  `singular report` requests a briefing; `singular ask "<question>" [--wait]`
  asks the supervisor a question. Both are **propose-only** — the model never
  writes; it may only emit a `proposedSettings` map restricted to the settings
  whitelist.
- Briefings are validated against
  `schemas/supervisor-report.v0.schema.json`
  (`singular.orchestration.supervisor-report.v0`) and written to
  `.singular-state/supervisor/latest.json` (+ pruned history); events
  `supervisor.report` / `.failed` / `.ask_started` / `.ask_answered` /
  `.ask_failed`. New knobs, all inert by default:
  `SINGULAR_SUPERVISOR_INTERVAL_MIN` (`0` = off; the L0 loop then auto-briefs at
  most once per interval, stamping before spawn so it cannot double-spawn),
  `SINGULAR_SUPERVISOR_TIMEOUT_SEC` (900), `SINGULAR_ASK_TIMEOUT_SEC` (600).
- Console: `POST /api/report` and `POST /api/ask` spawn the readonly runner
  (a second deliberate subprocess exception — the question is written to a
  file, never passed on argv; `start_new_session`; 429 while busy or inside
  the 60s report throttle); `GET /api/ask/<id>` and `GET /api/asks` read state
  pure-FS. `/api/home` gains `loop` (iteration/note from STATUS.md),
  `briefing` (latest report, narrative capped), and `supervisor`
  (`{intervalMin, enabled}`). Home renders a supervisor card (stage, loop
  note, briefing narrative + risks + next steps, refresh) and a propose-only
  chat with per-key **Apply chips** — a human click is the only write, through
  POST /api/settings. Ask/briefing runs stream in Consoles as `assistant`-kind
  sessions.

### Console — provider subscription quotas
- `/api/providers` gains an additive **`quota`** field (`singular.providers.v0`
  is unchanged otherwise). Codex exposes real usage: a bounded tail probe over
  its newest local rollout JSONL reads the last `rate_limits` (used-percent,
  window, reset time, plan type) — **rollout files only, never a credential**.
  Cursor reports tier-only; providers with no headless usage source report
  `not-exposed`; absent CLIs `cli-missing`.
- Home (above the links) and each Providers card render a **usage gauge** for
  Codex (percent used, window label, reset countdown, plan chip, staleness)
  and honest tier / not-exposed states for the rest; the section quiet-hides
  when nothing qualifies or `/api/providers` 404s. Live-only.

### Fixes
- Regenerated the engine console adapter
  (`plugin/adapters/console-adapter.v0.json`): its `logFileMaps.codexLogs` had
  drifted and, when loaded, stripped `auditor-codex.log` from the streamable
  set — restored, and the new `assistant-codex.log` / `supervisor-codex.log`
  names added, so adapter-loaded and adapter-less session streaming match.
- `test-autonomate-supervisor-gate.sh`'s cleanup trap no longer flakes on
  "Directory not empty" when the detached briefing tree is still writing under
  the fixture at exit (retry-tolerant `rm`).

### Tests
- Bash suite gains `test-supervise.sh`, `test-ask.sh`,
  `test-autonomate-supervisor-gate.sh` (stub-runner; byte-inert proof when the
  knob is unset), and `test-console-shell-dom.sh` — headless-Chrome
  `--dump-dom` assertions over the sidebar shell, the four-tab header, and the
  rebuilt matrix (skips cleanly when Chrome is absent).
- Python suite gains `CodexQuotaTests`, `ProvidersQuotaFieldTests`,
  `CollectHomeSupervisorTests`, `CollectAskTests`, `AskReportRouteTests`,
  `SessionsAssistantTests`; the no-subprocess and secret-leak guards are
  extended to the new collectors, and `/api/settings` stays byte-identical.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-18 — Providers: runtime status tab + Gemini/OpenCode/Cursor runners

See which agent CLIs are connected, at what version, under which account —
and switch the engine between them. Modeled on the multi-CLI provider
patterns of opencode / pi / t3code (probe → installed/version → auth status
→ ready/warning/error rollup with email · plan). `schemaVersion` stays v1.

### Engine — three new runners (six total)
- `engine/gemini-run.sh`, `engine/opencode-run.sh`, `engine/cursor-run.sh`
  join claude/codex/grok as full drop-in runners: same CLI surface, exit
  semantics (127 missing CLI, 124 timeout w/ process-tree kill, 86 resume
  refused, 3/4 parse/error), readonly restore guard, best-effort
  `--session-meta` (provider ids gemini/opencode/cursor; no session
  affinity v1). Headless invocations: `gemini -o json --yolo` (envelope
  accepted from stdout OR stderr — 0.42.x emits it on stderr behind
  warning lines), `opencode run --format json`, `cursor-agent -p
  --output-format json -f` (`--mode ask` for readonly). Flat model knobs
  `SINGULAR_{GEMINI,OPENCODE,CURSOR}_MODEL` (unset = the CLI's own default,
  flag omitted) + `_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 1200).
- Switch runners with `SINGULAR_RUNNER` in config `env{}` (proven to
  override the top-level `runner` key on every lib.sh source) — the
  console's "Use as default runner" writes exactly that.
- `singular doctor` now checks all six provider CLIs on PATH with
  file/env-inference auth hints (warn-only, no subprocess probes) and
  model-prefix sanity for the new keys.

### Console — Providers surface + /api/providers
- New **Providers** tab (5th surface): a status card per provider —
  installed + version, auth line (email · plan when the CLI prints them;
  otherwise a one-line reason plus a copyable login command), env-key
  presence chips, runner script + "default runner" badge + roles using it
  + last-used/exit evidence from session metadata, an editable model knob,
  and a "Use as default runner" action (applies next cycle). Live-only;
  disabled while viewing an archived plan.
- `GET /api/providers` (`singular.providers.v0`) + `--providers` one-shot:
  per-provider probes (`claude auth status`, `codex login status`,
  `cursor-agent about --format json`, `opencode auth list`, env/file
  inference for gemini; `<bin> --version` for versions) run in a thread
  pool with 3s timeouts, cached 60s, `?refresh=1` re-probes. The payload
  never contains credential values — only presence, counts, and strings
  the CLIs themselves print. This collector is the deliberate
  subprocess exception (like the git-backed snapshot); everything else
  stays pure-FS.
- Provider identity generalized: the runner→provider mapping is a
  registry lookup (was a hardcoded claude-else-codex guess), and
  `/api/config` + `/api/providers` honor env{} `SINGULAR_RUNNER`.
  POST /api/settings whitelist gains `SINGULAR_RUNNER` (validated
  `*-run.sh` name only) + the new model/timeout keys.

### Tests
- Bash 153/153 (new: test-gemini-run.sh / test-opencode-run.sh /
  test-cursor-run.sh incl. the stderr-envelope quirk case; doctor
  updated). Python 166/166 (new: CollectProvidersTests,
  ProvidersRouteTests — fake-binary PATH fixtures, secret-leak guard,
  cache TTL/refresh, runner-switch round-trip + rejection). Real
  end-to-end runner smokes on this machine: cursor pong/exit 0; gemini
  error-path surfaces the CLI's own auth message; opencode correctly
  reports not-connected. Headless-Chrome UI verification: 80/80
  assertions across real-repo and POST-fixture contexts at 1920×1080
  and 1280×700, zero pageerrors.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-18 — Plan threads: chat-style sequential plans

One repo no longer means one plan forever. When a DAG completes, archive it
as a browsable thread and start a fresh one — like chats in an LLM app: one
active plan, older plans read-only. `schemaVersion` stays **v1** (all
additions are new verbs/endpoints; archived plans are served from mini-repo
snapshots by the existing collectors).

### Engine — `singular plan archive` / `singular plan list`
- `singular plan archive [--name <display name>] [--force] [--no-commit]`
  moves the finished plan's durable record into
  `.singular-state/plans/<plan-id>/` laid out as a **mini-repo**
  (`docs/orchestration/{dag.v0.json,tasks,gates,areas,packets}` moved;
  `prompts/`, `planner-contract.md`, `decisions.md` copied so they stay
  live; `.singular-state/{events.ndjson,runs,sessions,leases,l1-leases,
  dispatch,inbox,origin-state.json,STATUS.md,circuit.json,
  planner-backoff.json,task-id-counter}` moved), writes a
  `manifest.json` (`singular.plan.manifest.v0`: name, archivedAt,
  engineVersion, branch, headSha, gates passed/total, taskCount, event
  span) and upserts the `plans/index.json` registry
  (`singular.plans.index.v0`, newest first).
- Safety: refuses (each override-able only with `--force`) while the
  autonomate loop is alive, the origin lock is held, a launched dispatch
  tree is still running, the DAG frontier is not `allComplete`, or
  `.worktrees/` still has entries (worktrees are never moved — run
  `singular gc` first). Runs under the origin lock.
- Reset: after archiving, the repo returns to the init starter DAG
  (`M0.scaffold`), a fresh `events.ndjson` seeded with a `plan.archived`
  event, and a cleared task-id counter (next thread numbers from
  TASK-0001); `docs/orchestration` is committed by default
  (`--no-commit` to skip). Config, secrets, locks, console files and
  `STOP` handling are never touched.
- `singular plan list [--json]` prints the registry (self-heals from
  per-plan manifests if the index is missing).

### Console — thread switcher + read-only historical mode
- `GET /api/plans` (`singular.plans.v0`) lists archived plans; `--plans`
  one-shot flag added.
- `?plan=<plan-id>` on the read endpoints (`/api/dag`, `/api/timeline`,
  `/api/overview`, `/api/task`, `/api/node`, `/api/area`, `/api/events`,
  `/api/sessions`, `/api/session`, `/api/prompts`, `/api/prompt`,
  `/api/raw`) serves the archived plan's snapshot — ids are validated
  against the registry and path-contained; unknown ids 404. `/api/state`,
  `/api/home`, `/api/config`, `/api/settings` ignore the param, and any
  POST carrying `?plan=` is rejected 400: **archived plans are
  read-only**.
- The compute cache is now multi-slot (LRU, capacity 4) so browsing an
  archived plan doesn't evict the live plan's cached views.
- UI: a plan switcher in the header lists the current plan and archived
  threads (name · date · gates); Home gains a "Previous plans" card.
  Selecting a thread reloads into `?plan=<id>` historical mode: a
  persistent "viewing archived plan — read-only" banner, all four Plan
  lenses + Consoles transcripts rendered from the archive, Agents (live
  settings) disabled, live polling frozen (immutable data is fetched
  once), and pin writes suppressed. "Back to live" returns to the active
  thread.

### Tests
- New `tests/test-plan-archive.sh` (preconditions, archive layout,
  reset, registry ordering, `--no-commit`, list `--json`); bash suite
  150/150.
- New `CollectPlansTests`, `PlanParamRoutingTests` (HTTP-layer:
  archived-vs-live payloads, traversal/malformed-id 404s, POST 400,
  `/api/state` param ignored), `ComputeCacheMultiSlotTests`;
  `collect_plans` added to the no-subprocess guard; python suite
  152/152. Headless-Chrome verification: 76 assertions across live +
  historical modes at 1920×1080 and 1280×700, zero pageerrors.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-17 — Workspace polish: Home, full-bleed canvas, editable settings, developer primitives

Field feedback on 0.6.0 ("half way there"): the dashboard should feel like a
full canvas per tab, the timeline garbled overlapping labels on dense lanes,
the matrix didn't use wide screens, settings were read-only, and the system
felt like a black box. `schemaVersion` stays **v1**; `POST /api/settings` is
the console's first write path and it only touches `singular.config.json`
`env{}` — orchestration state remains read-only.

### Workspace shell
- **Home** is a new landing surface (default route): health verdict +
  attention feed (STOP, breaker, planner backoff, stale L1 leases, disk,
  stale loop pidfile), per-stage gate progress, live event feed, a 14-day
  activity sparkline (dispatches/integrations/failures), throughput tiles,
  and quick links into the other tabs.
- The header slims to a single 44px row (brand, Home·Plan·Consoles·Agents
  nav, health, stop, conn, Refresh); the stat strip and plan pill retire —
  their content lives on Home, and the actionable status filters moved into
  the Plan workbench header. The bottom dock is deleted; every surface is a
  full-bleed workspace with hairline dividers.

### Plan surface fixes
- **Timeline**: per-lane label placement with measured text (inline /
  right-outside only when it fits before the next bar / hidden with hover +
  tooltip) and lanes clip overflow — overlapping garbled labels are gone.
  Real bar widths (6px min, adjacent slivers merged) replace the 18px blob
  floor; retry chips move to row ends; collapsed areas take one 30px row
  with the heat strip inline; sticky day labels; denser rows (20px bars).
- **Matrix**: cell size now derives from the pane width
  (`clamp(22..44px)`), so the grid uses a 16:9 screen instead of rendering
  a fixed 774px square; marks and diagonal pills scale with the cell.

### Agents: editable settings
- Role detail and a new System settings panel (all 23 knobs in 4 groups)
  edit model/effort/concurrency/safety knobs with kind-typed validation and
  per-key "applies next cycle" / "needs loop restart" labels. Saves go
  through **`POST /api/settings`** → atomic write into
  `singular.config.json` `env{}` (the layer the engine actually re-reads
  each cycle; `.env` is only read at loop launch). Whitelisted keys only —
  secrets and unknown config keys are never touched; derived knobs render
  read-only. `/api/settings` rows overlay config env{} so saved values are
  visible immediately.

### Developer primitives (no black boxes)
- **Prompts**: `GET /api/prompts` + `/api/prompt/<name>` serve the role
  prompt library (`docs/orchestration/prompts/`); the Agents role detail
  shows each role's template, and Consoles panes/rows carry a prompt chip
  opening the EXACT rendered prompt of that run (rendered `*-prompt.md`
  files now stream through the session reader as `kind:"prompt"`).
- **Raw view-source**: `GET /api/raw/<root>/<name>` (tasks incl.
  superseded, gates + reviews, leases, L1 leases, dispatch records, inbox
  packets, origin-state/circuit/planner-backoff/STATUS, config, DAG) with
  per-root allowlists and containment; quiet `{}` buttons on tasks, nodes,
  Home breaker/backoff, and Agents config open the underlying file in the
  inspector (pretty-printed JSON, path, size, mtime).
- **`GET /api/home`** (`singular.codex.home.v0`, `--home`): the at-a-glance
  digest powering Home — first server-side read of dispatch records and
  planner-backoff.json, pid-liveness without subprocesses.

### Migrating from 0.6.0
- No action required. The dock and `#dock` sizing knobs are gone; the event
  feed lives on Home. Bare URLs land on `#home` (all 0.6.0 routes and
  legacy deep links still work). New one-shot flags: `--home`, `--prompts`,
  `--prompt <name>`, `--raw <root>/<name>`.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-17 — Three-surface console redesign (Plan · Consoles · Agents)

A full information-architecture redesign of the read-only console, replacing
the static L0→L1→L2 column canvas with three purpose-built surfaces, plus the
server/engine data layer to power them. `schemaVersion` stays **v1** — every
API change is additive (three new endpoints, new fields on existing ones);
`singular migrate` is a no-op for 0.5.0 consumers.

### Plan surface (workbench over the DAG)
- Four lenses behind a vertical lens nav: **Timeline** (execution Gantt on
  compressed real time — per-attempt task bars with retry chains, gap-break
  glyphs for idle hours, hour/day gridlines, NOW line, coral gate diamonds,
  L0 reconcile-cycle strip, dependency hover tracing, CPM-projected region
  for ungated future nodes), **Matrix** (N×N dependency matrix, gate-status
  diagonal pills, blue-deps/green-dependents hover tracing, real topo-sort
  acyclicity footer), **DAG** (layered stage graph: collapsible S-stage
  ribbons, bezier edges, transitive ancestor/descendant tracing), and
  **Tasks** (the sortable task table, now with a DAG-node column).
- Right-hand node drilldown aside (gate, requiredCompletion, deps as chips,
  task rollup); the bottom-sheet inspector still owns full task detail.
- Hash router `#<surface>/<lens>/<selection>[:tab]`; all legacy deep links
  (`#TASK-…`, `#NODE:…`, `#L1:…`, `#PLAN`, `?list=1`) migrate automatically.

### Consoles surface (live operations room)
- Persistent **L0 supervisor pane** (semantic events stream + raw
  autonomate log, collapsible) with the highest visual weight; a dynamic
  region where role/task/area/phase/model-labeled agent consoles pop in as
  sessions go live (L1 panes span full width, L2 tile 2-up, cap 4), linger
  with their final state on completion (45s for failures), then collapse
  into a **recent rail** — which doubles as the idle/historical browser
  (finished sessions reopen with full parsed scrollback). Pin/solo/raw per
  pane; single 2s poll scheduler with an in-flight cap; `#consoles/<id>`
  deep links.

### Agents surface (role grid)
- Cards per runtime role (avatar + live glyph, active pill, current
  tasks/areas, model · effort chip, last-activity age) + a dimmed
  declared-roles strip; role detail with processes (jump to their console)
  and **read-only** settings showing env-key provenance
  (`model → claude-opus-4-8 (SINGULAR_CLAUDE_L2_MODEL)`) plus concurrency
  limits — the console observes, it never writes.

### Design system
- Adopted the warm-neutral **pm-go token layer** (`tokens.css`): warm paper
  + 24px printer's line grid, flat white panels (glass/backdrop-blur
  retired), six-tone signal language with **coral replacing violet** as the
  attention accent, Inter + Roboto Mono. Legacy token names alias to the new
  system, so retained chrome re-skinned without markup churn.
- Client rebuilt as ES modules (`main.js` + `core/` + `plan/` + `consoles/`
  + `agents/`), served by an extension-allowlisted asset route with
  resolved-path containment (subdirectories supported, no per-file registry).

### Server API (all additive)
- **`/api/dag`** (`singular.codex.dag.v0`, `--dag`): registry nodes merged
  with gate results, per-node task rollups (events-attributed with the
  `DAG node:` header fallback), L1 leases, frontier flags, `edges[]`, and
  stage/area swimlane metadata.
- **`/api/timeline`** (`singular.codex.timeline.v0`, `--timeline`,
  `?since=`): per-task attempt intervals reconstructed from events
  (dispatch records are overwritten per attempt — history lives in the
  journal), `liveNow` for running bars, gate marks, L0 reconcile cycle
  spans.
- **`/api/config`** (`singular.codex.config.v0`, `--config`): per-role
  model/effort resolved with the engine's own precedence (`.env` override >
  config `env{}` > runner default) with source-key provenance, plus limits
  and flags. Secrets in `.env` are never read (whitelisted parser).
- `/api/sessions`: rows gain durable `provider/model/effort/exitCode/
  attempt` + `sessionMeta{implementer,reviewer}` from session-meta files;
  `?limit=` (default 16, max 40); auditor logs discoverable.
- L0 supervisor log resolution: the server now follows whichever of
  `autonomate.out.log` / `autonomate.log` (the engine's actual `--detach`
  output) exists — the supervisor stream was previously invisible.
- `NODE_ID_RE` accepts slug node ids (`ctx-loader`) — `/api/node` 400'd
  every real consumer DAG id.

### Engine
- Auditor runner output → `$run_dir/auditor-codex.log` and decider output →
  `$run_dir/decider-codex.log` + `session-decider.json` (both previously
  `/dev/null`), so the two most watch-worthy roles stream in the console.

### Migrating from 0.5.0
- No action required. The old L0→L1→L2 graph canvas and the task-list
  drawer are gone; the task table lives at `#plan/tasks` and old deep links
  redirect. `?view=graph|list` is retired (hash routes replace it). The
  client is now ES-module based under `/assets/`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-17 — Field-hardening from the first external consumer run

Every change in this release traces to the singular-frontend V1 field run
(Jul 13–16, codex session 019f5ce7): a 4-day, 78-dispatch, 47-node run that
converged but lost ~40 of ~96 hours to engine defects and needed ~15 manual
state surgeries. `schemaVersion` stays **v1** — all schema changes are
additive (`authority` node field; new `gate-review.v0`), so `singular migrate`
is a no-op for 0.4.0 consumers.

### Autonomy & failure classification
- **Limit/quota windows require structured evidence**: only engine-written
  runner logs are scanned (never `.md`/model artifacts — repo prose like a
  "quota-banner" feature armed ≥13 false 30-minute backoffs in the field),
  markers are word-boundary contextual regexes, quota backoffs refuse to arm
  without a `logRef`, and import rejections are excluded from limit
  eligibility. **`SINGULAR_LIMIT_SLEEPTHROUGH`** (default 1) supersedes the
  deprecated `SINGULAR_DISABLE_LIMIT_SLEEPTHROUGH`.
- **Monotonic task ids**: durable counter seeded from every surface (tasks
  incl. `superseded/`, leases, dispatch records, worktrees, imported packets,
  `agent/*` branches). Archived ids can never be recycled (4 field
  collisions, 2 breaker halts); collisions reject the batch instead of
  overwriting, and `singular_lease_write` refuses to clobber
  accepted/integrated leases.
- **Duplicate guard v2**: status-aware (terminal tasks never block a
  successor — the blocked-task deadlock killed a whole night), keyed on the
  new `DAG node:` task header (legacy `S#/D#` token regex is fallback only),
  `Supersedes:` header bypasses the guard, and unknown-node matches require a
  full signature. Empty planner batches (`{"tasks": []}`) are a first-class
  no-op (`planner.no_tasks`), not invalid output.
- **Exit-code contract**: dispatch exit 2 = refusal (never breaker input),
  3 = decided-terminal, other = crash. Repeated refusals park the task
  (**`SINGULAR_REFUSAL_PARK_THRESHOLD`**=3) instead of starving the loop.
- **Whole-tree reap liveness**: descendants, process group, run-id command
  lines, and recent run-dir writes all count as alive
  (**`SINGULAR_STALE_HARD_MINUTES`**=240 caps the conservatism). The 0.4.0
  root-pid check destroyed accepted work under a live auditor.
- **Accepted-work auto-heal** (**`SINGULAR_AUTO_ACCEPT_EXISTING`**=1): a
  dispatch against an `accepted` lease re-accepts the stranded packet
  deterministically and enqueues it; a new `accept-pending` trap state means
  a post-acceptance crash never fails the lease.

### Runners & retries
- **`SINGULAR_CODEX_TIMEOUT_SEC`** (default 2400; 0 disables) bounds codex
  runs with a kill-tree, and opt-in **`SINGULAR_CODEX_IDLE_SEC`** kills runs
  whose JSONL output stops growing — field hangs ran 28–380 minutes
  unbounded. rc 124 classifies as timeout/infra everywhere already.
- **Empty-diff retries reconcile**: a retry whose content was committed by a
  prior attempt (gate green, owned files differ from base) proceeds instead
  of parking fully green work as `no-changes`.
- **Audit-verdict validation** joins decider-verdict validation
  (**`SINGULAR_AUDIT_VERDICT_VALIDATE`**=warn; `strict` re-runs the auditor).
  Legacy `pmgo.*` schema ids are tolerated-with-warning
  (**`SINGULAR_LEGACY_SCHEMA_MODE`**=warn; `reject` post-migration) — the
  0.4.0 hard rejection parked every decision in consumers scaffolded with
  legacy prompts (18.5h halt).

### Promotion & governance
- **Auto-promotion actually fires**: **`SINGULAR_AUTO_PROMOTE_GATES`** now
  defaults to 1; gates promote at integrate time (`promote-gate --if-ready`)
  the moment a node's last task lands, and the empty-queue reconcile pass no
  longer requires a free dispatch slot. Promotions count as loop progress.
- **`singular promote-gate` honors the config `promoter` key** (new
  `engine/promote-gate.sh` wrapper sources lib.sh; explicit env still wins);
  actionable errors; stderr progress heartbeat
  (**`SINGULAR_PROMOTE_PROGRESS_SECS`**=15).
- **Terminal-predecessor tolerance** (**`SINGULAR_PROMOTE_TOLERATE_TERMINAL`**=1):
  superseded/blocked predecessors with an integrated successor count as
  satisfied; `tasks/superseded/` is scanned.
- **Planner suppression** (**`SINGULAR_SUPPRESS_UNPROMOTED_REPLAN`**=1): nodes
  whose tasks are complete but whose gate is unpublished are not re-planned
  (the field's duplicate-churn source); a published failed gate keeps the
  node plannable.
- **Evaluation-gate governance**: DAG nodes may declare
  `authority: operator | agent-review-allowed` (additive). `kind: evaluation`
  nodes promote via `promote-gate --operator --evidence REF`, or — when
  opted in — via a valid PASSING **`gate-review.v0`** file at
  `gates/evidence/<node>.review.json` (independent reviewer identity,
  evidence refs, headSha ancestor check,
  **`SINGULAR_REVIEW_MAX_AGE_HOURS`**=168). The dag schema file drops 0.4.0's
  project-specific layer/kind enums to match the engine validator.

### Recovery becomes verbs
- New CLI: **`supersede`** (all four resurrection surfaces atomically, live-
  dispatch guard, `--force`), **`clear-backoff`**, **`breaker show|reset`**,
  **`stop [--wait]`**, **`resume`**, **`wake`**, **`gates [--json]`**,
  **`health [--json]`** (sub-2s digest with a stable hash field for cheap
  heartbeats + `attention[]`), **`gc [--dry-run]`**
  (**`SINGULAR_RUNS_KEEP`**=200 runs-history cap with reference protection,
  integrated-worktree pruning, events rotation at
  **`SINGULAR_EVENTS_MAX_MB`**=64), plus `lease` and `accept-packet` wiring.
- `next-areas --explain` emits per-node exclusion reasons; a corrupt gate
  file no longer crashes the frontier computation.
- `recover` reclassifies stale **L1 planning leases**
  (**`SINGULAR_RECOVER_L1`**=1; report-only before), reports orphaned
  worktrees **once** (`recover-orphans.json`), and can auto-prune clean
  integrated worktrees (**`SINGULAR_AUTO_PRUNE`**, default 0).
- Opt-in **`SINGULAR_INTEGRATE_REBASE`**: rebase-and-regate an audited branch
  once on merge conflict instead of terminally parking.
- Detached workers' process groups are killed on supersede `--force`
  (**`SINGULAR_KILL_ORPHAN_PGROUP`**=1) so gate webservers stop leaking.

### Lifecycle & loop
- **`singular auto --detach`**: supported daemonized launch (setsid
  double-fork, `.singular-state/autonomate.log`, post-launch liveness check).
- Interruptible naps: STOP takes effect mid-sleep within
  **`SINGULAR_SLEEP_POLL_SEC`**=10; `singular wake` / `clear-backoff` end naps
  early — killing sleep children (which killed the whole loop in the field)
  is never needed. Quota budget counts only actually-slept seconds.

### Console & observability
- `/api/state` no longer shells `make orch-*` probes or a blocking `du`: the
  snapshot is assembled natively from durable files, disk usage samples on
  its own 5-minute background cache, and a stale-but-marked snapshot
  (`stale`/`computing`/`snapshotAgeSeconds`) is served instantly while a
  refresh runs (`?fresh=1` still blocks). Snapshot keys `gateD0`/`gateD1`
  are replaced by `orchestration.gates {passed,total,byNode}`.
- `singular console --ensure | --status | --stop`; the URL/pid persist at
  `.singular-state/console.url`/`console.pid`; the banner moved to stderr
  (one-shot JSON is pipe-pure); default port **8765** with free-port
  fallback; `singular status` prints the live console URL.
- `origin-state.json` gains `gates{passed,total}`, `completedNodes`,
  per-status `taskCounts`, and writer provenance; STATUS.md states its
  staleness contract.

### Doctor & skill
- Doctor preflights: model-prefix sanity, `~/.codex/hooks.json` parse (FAIL),
  MCP server fan-out count, legacy `pmgo.*` id scan (FAIL + migrate pointer),
  stale pidfiles, disk floor, `.worktrees` size, console-port availability.
- Skill rewritten for cheap monitoring: a `singular health --json`
  digest-compare heartbeat loop, a full 0.5.0 knob table, six numbered
  recovery recipes, the operator-gate escalation contract, and a new
  `references/artifacts.md` (canonical field names per artifact + jq
  cookbook). Console trigger words (dashboard/viewer/visualization/UI) added
  to the skill and plugin manifest.

### Migrating from 0.4.0
- **No schema migration**: `schemaVersion` stays v1; `authority` and
  `gate-review.v0` are additive.
- **Behavior flips (opt out in config `env{}` if needed)**:
  `SINGULAR_AUTO_PROMOTE_GATES=1` (was 0), codex runs bounded at 2400s (set
  `SINGULAR_CODEX_TIMEOUT_SEC=0` to restore unbounded), exit-2 refusals no
  longer feed the breaker, planner suppression of pending-promotion nodes,
  stale L1 lease reclassification (`SINGULAR_RECOVER_L1=0` restores
  report-only), duplicate guard ignores terminal tasks, legacy `pmgo.*`
  verdict ids tolerated (`SINGULAR_LEGACY_SCHEMA_MODE=reject` restores strict).
- **Console**: default port is 8765; the launch banner moved to stderr —
  update any script that parsed it from stdout; `gateD0`/`gateD1` snapshot
  keys are gone.
- **New state files**: `.singular-state/task-id-counter`, `WAKE`,
  `console.url`/`console.pid`, `recover-orphans.json`,
  `dispatch/<task>.refusals`. Task-id sequences may show gaps (intentional).
- **Consumer templates**: add `DAG node: <node-id>` to `tasks/TEMPLATE.md`
  and planner prompts (scaffold only creates-if-missing; new consumers get
  it automatically).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-13 — Context-aware orchestration (self-hosted S0–S7 complete)

Completes the context-evolution plan the engine built against itself: 107
worker-implemented, independently audited, gate-promoted tasks across 20
executable DAG nodes, closed by an operator-authored experiment report
(`docs/context-build-plan/experiment-report.md`). Additive and default-OFF at
the raw engine level; the **shipped config flips five knobs ON per the
report's per-knob decisions** (see below). Raw-default flips are deferred to
0.5 with a test-migration slice (OFF-parity tests pin unset == legacy).

- **Context packets + assumption ledger** (`SINGULAR_CTX_PACKET`): planner
  reasoning residue (decisions / assumptions / rejected alternatives /
  inspected symbols) rides task files into worker, fix, and audit prompts;
  per-run assumption ledger with host-derived status transitions in the
  assumption grammar `[open|validated|violated]`.
- **Artifact secret scan + quarantine** (`SINGULAR_CTX_ARTIFACT_SCAN`):
  `secret-scan.sh --artifacts` covers capsules, session meta, packets,
  critique and paired-audit records; hits rename to `.quarantined`, emit
  `ctx.artifact_secret`, and are excluded from every prompt-assembly and
  rehydration path without changing task outcomes.
- **Explicit session routing** (`SINGULAR_CTX_ROUTING`): one dispatcher
  (`singular_ctx_route`) returning `continue|resume|fork|fresh|rehydrate`
  with a reason code; window-pressure and diff-volume refusal gates;
  generalized session leases; structural taint marking makes
  independence-pinned steps (final + paired audits) unreachable by resumed or
  rehydrated sessions; per-role strategy/outcome metrics splits.
- **Rehydration** (`SINGULAR_REHYDRATE`): deterministic, capped,
  quarantine-aware packets assembled from durable artifacts (packets,
  capsules, ledgers, critiques, decision records) injected on refused-resume
  lineage steps, with the packet manifest recorded in strategy events.
  Optional authored-knowledge manifest ingestion (`SINGULAR_CTX_MANIFEST` +
  additive `contextManifest` config field): select → eligibility
  (`load-when` across role/step/node/task) → compose → inject → record,
  fixture-contract only (singular-brain bridge, no runtime dependency).
- **Context graph** (`SINGULAR_CTX_GRAPH`): `context-graph.v0` schema
  (append-only JSONL nodes/edges, full edge taxonomy,
  `evidenceClass: authoritative|claim`, provenance refs) + S0–S5
  event-to-graph mapping; deterministic projector over all record families;
  incremental sync ≡ rebuild; loss-free delete/rebuild; query read API
  (neighbors, lineage walk, open-contradictions); `singular graph
  rebuild|sync|query` CLI. Subgraph-selected rehydration (lineage-walk
  selection, rejected observations excluded, contradictions surfaced first)
  with a flat-vs-subgraph A/B arm.
- **Experiment toolchain** (`SINGULAR_CTX_EXPERIMENT` /
  `SINGULAR_CTX_ARMSTATE`): per-arm aggregators (escape-rate, cost, bias,
  attempts-to-accept, findings-per-attempt, resume/rehydrate hit-rates,
  refusal reason mix), treatment-vs-control delta, knob-state provenance
  recording + consistency audit, markdown renderers, composed report body,
  `singular experiment-report` CLI, operator hand-off record.
- **Shipped-config defaults per the experiment report**: `PLANNER_SESSION`,
  `PLAN_CRITIQUE`, `CTX_PACKET`, `CTX_ROUTING`, `CTX_ARTIFACT_SCAN` ON and
  `PAIRED_AUDIT_PCT=25` in the self-dock config; `REHYDRATE`,
  `CTX_MANIFEST`, `CTX_GRAPH`, `CTX_EXPERIMENT` stay opt-in pending
  live-scale / consumer evidence.
- New event types: `context.strategy_selected`, `context.resume_failed`,
  `ctx.arm_assigned`, `ctx.artifact_secret`, `ctx.paired_audit`,
  `ctx.critic_recheck`, `ctx.packet_malformed`, `plan.critiqued`,
  `plan.revised`, `plan.revise_parked`, `planner.backoff_active`.

## [0.4.0-m1] — 2026-07-11 — Context-evolution M0–M3 (self-hosted, unreleased dev pin)

Built by the engine itself under `docs/context-build-plan/` (self-docked, all
tasks worker-implemented, independently audited, and gate-promoted with hashed
evidence). Everything below is additive and default-OFF unless noted.

- **Self-measurement**: `singular metrics --json` over the attempts index +
  event log; deterministic per-task A/B arms (`SINGULAR_CTX_AB`); sampled
  post-acceptance paired fresh audits (`SINGULAR_PAIRED_AUDIT_PCT`).
- **Planner session persistence and resume** (`SINGULAR_PLANNER_SESSION`):
  per-node session meta, node-lineage + template-sha gates, session leases,
  rc-86 fresh fallback, reason-coded `context.strategy_selected` events.
- **Plan critique** (`SINGULAR_PLAN_CRITIQUE`): `plan-critique.v0` schema,
  fresh read-only skeptic critic over staged batches, critique-aware L0
  import (approve/revise/park, fail-closed on missing record, fail-open on
  critic infra).
- **Plan revision loop** (`SINGULAR_PLAN_REVISE_MAX`): bounded
  revise → (resume|fresh) → re-critique with per-finding dispositions and
  `plan.revised` provenance events; critic re-critique may resume the
  critic's own session (skeptic-only).
- **Invariant redefined**: the old "resume is a token-cost optimization that
  never changes a task outcome" is replaced by **evidence invariance** —
  routing never changes what counts as evidence; outcomes may improve with
  continuity and the improvement is measured. Advocate/skeptic line documented.
- Hermeticity hardening from self-docking: suite scrubs inherited SINGULAR_*
  env and runs tests with stdin from /dev/null.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-10 — Initial public release of singular

This is the first public release of singular. It ships detached dispatch **ON by
default** (`SINGULAR_DETACHED_DISPATCH=1`): the reconcile cycle no longer blocks on
its worker batch. The legacy batch barrier held the origin lock across every worker
(minutes to hours), freezing packet import, integration of already-finished work,
recovery, STATUS, and STOP responsiveness until the slowest worker finished. With
detached dispatch on, reconcile pre-leases each frontier task, spawns the worker in
its own session, and returns within seconds; the reaper attributes outcomes on later
cycles via dispatch records + exit files.

### Detached dispatch (default ON: `SINGULAR_DETACHED_DISPATCH=1`)

- Reconcile pre-leases each frontier task (`status=planned`, scope published) and
  spawns the worker in its own session via `dispatch-wrap.sh`, then returns within
  seconds; the origin lock is held for the cycle's control work only. Set
  `SINGULAR_DETACHED_DISPATCH=0` to restore the legacy batch wait path.
- **Dispatch records** (`.singular-state/dispatch/<taskId>.json`) + worker exit
  files; a **reaper** (`singular_reap_dispatches`, run at the top of every
  apply/actuate cycle before recovery) attributes completions, failures, and
  crashes (pid + `ps lstart` liveness, defeating pid reuse). Crash detection
  drops from the 60-min stale-lease window to ~one cycle.
- `reconcile.sh --drain` blocks until no launched dispatch records remain
  (tests, clean shutdown). New stdout fields `reaped_ok=`, `reaped_failures=`,
  `workers_running=`, `detached_dispatch=` (additive; legacy fields intact).
- Autonomy accounting (flag-gated): a dispatch alone is no longer progress —
  progress is an observed completion, an integration, or newly planned work;
  reap failures count toward the circuit breaker. Batch-mode accounting unchanged.
- `recover.sh`: pid-aware fast-stale backstop — an active lease whose dispatch
  pid is gone is reclassified immediately instead of after the stale window.
- New events: `origin.dispatch_reaped`, `origin.worker_reaped` (in-cycle wait
  now also records per-worker exit + duration for utilization baselines).

### Concurrency hardening (always on)

- Lease/task state writes (`singular_lease_write`, `singular_lease_set_status`,
  `singular_lease_bump_retry`, `singular_lease_update_owned`,
  `singular_task_set_status`) are now tmp+rename atomic — no torn reads while
  workers and reconcile mutate control state concurrently.
- `integrate.sh` merge/abort/finalize and reconcile's control-state `add`+`commit`
  now run under the repo-wide git-op lock shared with worker git operations
  (the regression gate still runs outside the lock).
- Both dispatch modes spawn through `dispatch-wrap.sh`, which persists the
  driver's exit code and backstops a lease the driver never owned (or died
  holding) so it stops consuming a concurrency slot.

### Context continuity

- Host-built per-attempt **context capsules**: a hash-stamped
  `implementer-capsule.json` (what the worker was tasked with) and
  `reviewer-capsule.json` (what the auditor reviewed/concluded).
- A **findings ledger** (`findings-status.json`) upserted from each audit
  verdict, with stable finding ids (format-insensitive) tracked open/resolved.
- **Structured fix prompts** carry the authoritative open findings forward on
  retry, replacing the truncated byte-tail (`SINGULAR_FIX_PROMPT_STRUCTURED=0`
  restores the legacy `fix_hints` tail byte-for-byte).
- **Re-audit delta prompts**: prior findings + fix diff + per-id verification
  targets, requesting an additive `findingsStatus` map
  (`{<findingId>: "resolved" | "still-open"}`) alongside the normal verdict.
- **Per-attempt artifact archive** under `runs/<id>/attempts/<n>/` (root files
  copied, never moved) with an `attempts/index.json`.
- New events: `context.strategy_selected`, `findings.ledger_updated`,
  `l1.attempt_archived`.

### Session affinity

- Optional role-keyed runtime **session resume** (`codex exec resume`,
  `claude -r`) behind 10 staleness gates, defaulting ON
  (`SINGULAR_SESSION_AFFINITY=1`). Any gate failure — or a runner that refuses the
  resume — degrades to a fresh run within the same attempt. Session resume is a
  token-cost optimization that **never changes a task outcome**.
- New event: `context.resume_failed`.

### Reliability

- **Infra-failure isolation**: worker/auditor infrastructure failures (timeouts,
  unparseable verdicts) re-run only the failed role, bounded
  (`SINGULAR_WORKER_INFRA_MAX=1`, `SINGULAR_AUDIT_INFRA_MAX=2`) and *without*
  consuming the review/retry budget; on exhaustion they surface as `worker-infra`
  / `audit-infra`.
- **Decider fast-path** (`SINGULAR_DECIDER_FAST=1`): a deterministic host policy
  table resolves unambiguous `(failure-class, retries-left)` pairs; ambiguous
  cases still consult the model decider.
- **Host task preflight**: malformed tasks are blocked before any lease, worktree,
  or model run.
- New events: `audit.infra_retry`, `worker.infra_retry`, `decider.fast_path`,
  `l1.preflight_failed`.

### Versioning

- Root `SCHEMA_VERSION` file as the data-contract version (`v1` for this
  release); `.singular-version` is the canonical engine pin.
- `singular doctor` gains schema-mismatch (FAIL) and pin-disagreement (warn) checks;
  `singular migrate` + the `migrations/<from>-to-<to>.sh` contract bring a repo's
  `schemaVersion` forward (see `migrations/README.md`).
- Ships the `v0-to-v1` migration that backfills the current scaffold and rewrites
  legacy `pmgo.orchestration.*` namespace references.

### Console

- `schemaVersion`-keyed `plugin/adapters/console-adapter.v0.json` with per-key
  precedence: repo override > engine-shipped > built-in. Built-ins remain the
  no-adapter fallback.

### Back-compat

- With no adapter resolvable, every console endpoint behaves byte-identically to
  the pre-adapter console; a malformed adapter is ignored with a warning.
- All new behavior is gated behind env knobs at their historical-equivalent or
  opt-in defaults; `findingsStatus` is additive (never required) on the audit
  verdict.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

Initial extraction of the bootstrap orchestration engine into a standalone,
installable package.

- Carved `engine/` (shell scripts) + `schemas/` (8 JSON contracts) out of the
  source repo, preserving exec bits.
- Schemas now ship **with** the engine and resolve relative to the install, not the
  consumer repo.
- Config contract (`singular.config.json` + `config.local.sh`) introduced so every
  per-repo knob lives in the consumer repo, never in engine files.
- `dag.sh` validator parameterized: layer/kind vocabulary and required nodes come
  from the DAG manifest; the storage-proof regime moved behind a module hook.
- Test suite abstraction-cleaned: live-state assertions removed; fixtures use a
  generic layer vocabulary.
- `singular` CLI + `install.sh` for install-once / run-anywhere with per-repo
  version pins.
- Visualization plugin vendored under `plugin/` and decoupled from project
  specifics.
