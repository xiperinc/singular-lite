# TASK-1120: interrupted started attempt fixture
Status: ready
Area: brain
Target branch: `target`
Worker branch: `agent/brain/TASK-1120`
Test policy: `strict_test_first`
Gate command: `true`
Dispatch mode: canonical
Depends on: []
## Objective
Continue a started attempt whose driver exited without a terminal disposition.
## Scope
Owned files:
- `app.txt`
## Acceptance Criteria
- The retained worker output survives one native continuation.
